hey everyone welcome back to my channel
my name is Michael Regina I'm an author
and illustrator of children's graphic
novel specifically the sleepover which
is currently available wherever books
are sold and then a pretty cool thing
that happened recently the first foreign
edition of any book I've ever made has
come out so the Dutch translation for
the sleepover recently came out in
stores so if you live in the Netherlands
and are interested in checking out my
book you can so on my channel one of the
things I like to do is discuss different
ways to be creative and sort of the
challenges and tools that I've used to
help me overcome things I've talked
about using solo role playing games to
help me write I've talked about the
process of coming up with your story's
theme and uh using your job as a tool
and all those sort of things and one of
the the tools I wanted to talk about
I've been wanting to talk about this for
a while actually is one of my favorite
uh discoveries over the last couple
years as I got into uh role playing
games and this is um solo journaling
role playing games now this is um a
little bit different than uh some of the
like main things you might be used to
hearing about something like Dungeons
and Dragons or that sort of thing solo
journaling games are sort of their own
genre and it's been one of the more
interesting things that I've discovered
in the last couple years and I figured
uh I would talk about this because I
think these are a really really oh let's
see a really really great tool to help
those who are wanting to learn to write
uh to discover their own creativity and
find their way into discovering stories
and also using story games to bolster
their confidence so I figured that's
what I'd talk about today before I dive
into solo journaling games please like
And subscribe on the channel it's been
really fun watching the channel grow and
all the different comments and feedback
and emails I've received from you all
over time has been uh really really cool
so thanks for being here I hope that
this will be uh something you've never
heard of before and then we will uh and
something that will help you just you
know be more creative and have more fun
telling stories so what is a a solo
journaling game so if you're familiar
with something like Dungeons and Dragons
a role playing game is collaborative
storytelling game with game mechanics
built into it and what makes all these
games a lot of fun typically is that you
get a group of people together at the
table and you play through a story and
there's a dungeon master and that
dungeon master is telling everyone what
what's sort of happening and the players
are reacting and it becomes this really
sort of free flowing narrative
experience where things certain things
are open and certain things are sort of
tailored and uh it's a lot of fun to
watch a story un full that way and as
I've talked about in some of my other
videos you can certainly play these
games even solo uh I have a lot of fun
doing this whenever I'm looking for a
way to unwind or if I just kind of want
to explore a new type of story it's a
lot of fun to break out a game that I
have on my wall and just play a session
or two in it and start to get a feel for
like what is a story like this uh feel
like but the difference between
something like Dungeons and Dragons or
one of these other games or what I did
in my last video about this subject in
Solo journaling games is solo journaling
games are actually a much more
structured storyline experience uh than
the those kinds of games and that's what
I want to to dive in a little bit here
so um I've got a stack here of games
that I purchased and I want to talk a
little bit about some of the Dynamics
I'm going to also do like a quick review
of some of these but just to kind of set
up the idea so in a Solo journaling game
uh you are basically going to buy a game
that is tailored around a specific
subject uh normally has some sort of
theme and the author has been very
specific about like this game is about
this kind of story these kinds of s and
this sort of thing and what they're
trying to do is guide you through a
narrative experience and if you're a
young writer looking for an ability you
know an opportunity to learn how to
write or you just want to take the
pressure off of yourself of doing so
that's where these games can really
shine because what they basically do is
they they do all the setup for you so if
you find a game that you think is really
cool you can purchase it sit down play
its prompts and at the end of that
process you're going to have a really
kind of cool narrative experience and it
just sort of takes all this pressure off
of you from trying to create and
generate ideas on your own so this game
for example is a game called artifact
like I said I'll talk about this a
little bit more in general uh later on
but this whole game is built around the
idea that you are playing as a sentient
or magical artifact and it's being
handed down throughout the generations
uh to different wielders and this sort
of thing and uh each sort of Entry or
prompt builds upon that narrative so
that you uh you get to basically tell
the story through f following these
prompts of this story as it gets passed
on through thousands of years and into
the hands of different people so for
example fantasy is not really a genre
that I've spent a lot of time writing in
but since I started playing role playing
games like Dungeons and Dragons and
dungeon world and the One Ring I've
spent a lot more time in these kinds of
games uh in these kinds of Worlds and
games like this kind of give me a
framework by which I can play stories
and come up with stories in this sort of
thing so just an example of of one of
the reasons why I think these are so
great so um my wife has for a long time
said that she wanted to write stories
and I would often ask her like you know
what's the biggest thing holding you
back and the thing that she said was
that she didn't know where to start and
so I actually purchased her a uh a game
that I'll talk about later called seven
murders till midnight and I got this for
her as a Christmas present because I
figured hey you know let's see if this
might sort of thing might help you tell
your own kind of story picked it up and
she had a lot of fun creating her own
story and seeing how this murder mystery
investigation played out and because it
just basically provides prompts along
the way you um you basically get to
discover the story as it goes so um
let's you know I'll talk a little bit
about the way this one works as an
example of like how do story uh
journaling role playing games work so in
seven murders to midnight you play a
person who's investigating a series of
murders and through the course of seven
days you're going to play through
prompts and discover who is the person
that's guilty who's the person that's
been doing this and arrive at a
conclusion at the end what's cool about
the game is it uh you set up your your
investigator or the person who's
investigating these these murders you
also uh have prompts for each day of the
week because it takes place over the
course of the week and these prompts
provide kind of a basic setup for like
what is happening at the start of that
day and then you draw a card and then
based on the prompt of that card you
determine what's happening throughout
the course of that day and then you play
another card that sends you off into a
new direction that is often filled with
uh a series of challenges and this sort
of thing so
again it sort of will pose a question
something like this so for example let's
take a look here so on day five if you
were to draw a three clubs it says the
body had been surgically altered to
resemble the previous victims were the
other victims altered as well so it
tells you like this is what's happening
within the story and then it asks you
additional questions for you to build
upon and then you continue to follow the
prompts again um what these games do
that's so great is that they basically
give you a structure because one of the
things I've learned the most over being
a a writer more than anything it's more
than just like the words in front of the
other is the ability to understand how
story structure works and there's
obviously a lot of really great books
out there that teach story structure
like the save the Cat book and that sort
of thing but if you're just learning it
can feel often daunting and what's cool
about these games is that they provide
you that sense of structure because
they're going to start off with
something the and the the journey is
going to slowly get more and more
intense as it goes along then once you
get to the end of that game you're left
with this really cool uh sort of like
Journal artifact of the experiences that
you went through in the game and you can
then take that and do with it what you
want maybe you want to turn that into
your own story you want to just leave it
as it is the experience of playing the
game was great uh whatever the case
might be you're sort of left there with
it what I've so loved about these games
as I've spent time playing them and uh
by myself and with other people is it
really unlocks people's sense of
creativity it gives you just enough
rails for everybody at the table to be
able to have this sort of guided story
experience and going from a beginning a
middle to an end and at the end of that
story everyone feels like they've
collaboratively played into it and what
I've often seen is that someone who
might think of themselves as not
particularly creative or that they
struggle at the end of that process they
can go like wow that was pretty cool I
can really you know I came up with some
really cool ideas and it's often fun to
look at someone and say see look you're
very creative uh you just needed a
little bit of help along the way um and
and hopefully that just helps people see
that they have this great creativity
inside of them that they can then unlock
to go off and do really cool things but
this is one of the reasons why I love
role playing games in general is that
they Propel us through storytelling by
giving us mechanics to do it and and
they provide some rails in fact I so
love these sorts of things that um I'm
working on a new graphic novel series
and I had been playing a lot of
different role playing games as an aid
to this process of working on this new
graphic novel series I wanted to play a
role playing game and solo role play the
scripts out so that I could sort of
allow a certain amount of Randomness and
I could bring in new and cool ideas and
um I'll be honest I was playing these
very sort of like open-ended games
similar to like vason or taals from the
loop and this sort of thing and the the
challenge was the series I'm working on
is very concise very like structured and
it needs to the story needs to happen in
a pretty rapid clip and so I was finding
that um those games were just providing
too much wiggle room and so one of the
cool things I did with this is I have
basically decided like that I like these
sorts of games so much I wanted to
design a game that was basically like
tailor made to uh to make this graphic
novel series I'm working on so I'm kind
of I'm I'm designing a game to be used
to write this new graphic novel series
and it might feel a little bit like a
like a detour off into the woods
somewhere but it's actually been a super
helpful process for me to sit down and
go like how would I structure this sort
of story how would I um you know put the
pieces of these stories together so that
at the end it's a fairly predictable
kind of process like I do think when
you're creating a series or something
that people come into it with certain
expectations and a straightup solo role
playing experience like I've done on my
channel is maybe a little too open but
because solo journaling games provide
such a kind of structured storytelling
approach it felt like the right course
of action and I've just been having a
great time and I'm learning a lot of
things about the story but then it's
keeping the the the details a little
open so that I can explore and come up
with different ideas and that sort of
thing and you know maybe one day I'll
show it with you all once the series
either gets announced or is closer to
coming out uh but for now I just kind of
enjoying it in the background and it's
helping unlock a lot of creativity for
me so uh what I would like to do is
share with you all some games that I
picked up so that if you're looking for
recommendations that this all sounds
like man that's a really cool thing I'd
like to pick up some games I'll tell you
the ones I picked up and you can see if
any of them uh look interesting to you
I'll go ahead and uh bring up again uh
seven murders till midnight I recommend
this game it seems like a lot of fun my
wife played it and she enjoyed it but
the one game that uh by these same
creators that I have played was the game
transformation so if you were g a fan of
things that are sort of more Cosmic
horror or you know there's body Horror
in this for sure and basically you're
playing um a person and their companion
as as your main character slowly changes
over time into a monster so it says a
solo RPG about the monster you're
becoming and I've played through this
entire game and I had a great time with
it I set up this world in which there
was a father and a son uh following a
recent divorce and they go off to the
woods together to kind of like have a
family vacation and then um slowly the
dad begins to transform into a monster
and this son is sort of left in this
terrible situation of like how do I
survive when my dad is turning into a
monster so this was a lot of fun I
really enjoyed this I also picked up up
a game called Whispers in the walls this
I picked up actually at uh at Origins
last year and uh this game is a a solo
investigative journaling game it's a
pretty straightforward game actually
there's not a lot of additional
mechanics where you're like rolling to
succeed or not it basically provides
nothing but a bunch of prompts that you
then respond to and It ultimately builds
to a conclusion but uh essentially
you're using a deck of cards to draw
from and then you get a prompt based on
what you draw so like the hearts levels
in this are the ws and this game does
have some uh additional tools that it's
giv you to be able to to play through it
so it's got a a d66 table for uh objects
and books and then also a yes no table
so if you're unsure like is that what's
happening you can roll against this yes
no table to determine whether or not
that's the case this is a really cool uh
fun uh very like I said straightforward
solo role playing game I want to
actually use this in conjunction with uh
monster of the week uh because I think
the this gives you a really great
framework for some cool stuff so one
game I played with my son we did this as
a duet game and had a lot of fun with it
is this game called kirn's doom kirn's
doom is basically like if you're a fan
of things like Annihilation or these
sort of like spatial horror stories
where a group of explorers are going to
go into a strange place where a strange
object has been found and explore it and
encounter whatever Horrors it's got this
game is certainly like right up that
alley I bought the PDF and printed it
out and um it's a very straightforward
game as well like you're going to start
off you're going to create a group of
explorers and then you're going to
decide like what is this sort of strange
object or landmark that's appeared and
then through the course of um play
you're going to explore that landmark
and determine whether or not your crew
gets in or out I played this with my son
one morning we had a great time with it
and um what was cool is at the end like
I think our group would not have
survived but he was basically like I
want us all to live so everybody lived
um this was one of the first ones I
picked up it's called the portal at Hill
house this again is also a pretty
straightforward uh solo role playing
game using a deck of cards and the goal
of it is that there's this house that's
sort of stuck in this weird temporal uh
time Loop or strange occurrence and then
by exploring it you're looking for three
objects that will shut down the uh the
portal from destroying the home and also
the world and all this sort of stuff
again very simple straightforward rules
it's a lot of fun if you want sort of a
very weird Eerie uh experience I I
definitely recommend this one if you're
looking for something a little Cozier
there is the last tea shop and this one
is um a very simple quick game in which
you play as a um a te- shop owner that
kind of exists between the land of the
living and the Land of the Dead and so
when you're playing through it you
basically create te's and you set up
tees so that when people come uh to your
tea shop they are uh you're you're
basically welcoming ghosts into your tea
shop and you're going to hear their
story and what's going on with them
before they pass pass on to the
afterlife uh again a little bit Cozier
there's nothing like violence or
anything going on uh it's a little bit
more meditative and yeah it's it's a lot
of fun and then too I thought I would
talk about that I'm actually I I may
bring to the channel as a a live play um
are lichdom and artifact and uh one of
the things I've been playing over time
has been this fantasy series um that is
built upon this idea of a world that is
kind of recovering from a great War
and there is a warrior character that
I've created uh and he has basically
like uh won this war he used a magical
sword uh to defeat this uh this Lich and
now now he's returned home and he's
basically looking for Solace but in the
course of looking for Solace all you
know all heck breaks loose in the world
again but I I thought artifact would be
a great tool for me to discover like
what is this sword that he used to
destroy this evil Menace and save the
rest of the world and I thought I would
play through this to understand like
what that sword is where it came from
what its powers are and its history
because I think it's actually going to
become pretty integral part of the story
so I'd love to play through this at some
point and then um the villain in the
story is a lich who has been defeated by
the main character in this game lichdom
I've actually played through this uh in
a duet fashion where you get another
person you play as competing Wizards uh
trying to achieve lichdom and we played
this game and had a blast with it and in
the this story yeah you're playing as a
witch or you know wizard sorcerer
whatever who is seeking immortality
through lichdom and through the course
of play you're going to watch them
either slowly devolve into failure or
success and becoming a lich and I
thought this would be a fun one too to
understand the history of my Lich uh if
you're not a fan of Me Myself and die
the YouTube channel I recommend checking
that out he did a whole playthrough of
this game uh and set up for his most
recent Ser uh season of his show
and then if you want something that's
got a little bit more of an open Nature
to it so these are obviously quite
structured um they provide a big
framework for like how the story would
play out I recommend checking out little
town this is the game that my wife has
moved on to from playing Seven murders
till midnight uh and this game is a solo
investigative game as well but it's a
little less on Rails but it is designed
to be played solo so it definitely Hold
Your Hand a bit more and it gives you a
lot of guidance on how to to solve for
problems and provide that sort of thing
and the gist of this is um that you play
a Young investigator in a strange Twin
Peaks like city as you encounter
whatever sort of mystery is going on
around town so I I recommend little town
if you're looking for something that's
got more of that uh you know sort of
investigative nature to it uh this is
one of the supplements to the game uh
called Eerie town and this one I think
is like the more X Files like uh you
know X Files like uh expansion for the
game so that's solo journaling uh RPGs
if that sounded really cool to you I
definitely recommend trying one of these
out if you're a writer who's like man I
would love to write but I get so
intimidated by it these are a great
place to start you can pick them up on
drive-through RPG you can pick them up
on it
itch.io um they're usually very
affordable they're usually small enough
that you could purchase the PDF and even
look at it there or print it out for
yourself and I think the more you do
this sort of thing the more you'll gain
in your confidence that you can tell
stories and you can um you can go from
this they're like a great Gateway dve
into your own creativity and realizing
that uh your potential is a Storyteller
so I recommend checking out some solo
RPGs and um if you'd like to see me talk
a little bit more about solo role
playing you can check out the video
series I did on using any role playing
game to create the outline for your
story otherwise thank you for being on
this channel it's been a lot of fun
hanging out with you I do want to do
more solo role playing in the future
it's just I'm having a hard time finding
the time to do it but uh hopefully uh
we'll be doing that in the near future
so again uh if you want to learn more
you can check out this video series I
did on using solo role playing games to
write your own story and until next time
I'll talk to you later bye
