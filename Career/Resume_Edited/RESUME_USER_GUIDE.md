## Choose Your Output Format

I'll ask which format you prefer:

| Option | What You Get |
|--------|--------------|
| **Full Rewrite** | Complete revised resume ready to use |
| **Tracked Changes** | Before/after for each section with explanations |

## What You'll Receive

After submitting your resume, I'll provide:

- **Bullet rewrites** using the Action Verb + Task + Result formula
- **Summary rewrite** following the 4-line structure recruiters respond to
- **Keyword optimization** for ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems)
- **Skills prioritization** based on your target role
- **Formatting recommendations** to pass the 6-second recruiter scan
- **Common mistakes** identified and fixed

## Key Frameworks I Use

### The Bullet Formula
```
Action Verb + Task + Result
```
**Before:** "Worked on website updates"
**After:** "Improved site load time by 40% through optimized code deployment"

### Impact Logic (for bullets without metrics)
If you don't have hard numbers, I'll help you show impact through:
- **Scope** - Scale and complexity of your work
- **Quality** - What you improved or made better
- **Consistency** - How regularly you contributed
- **Collaboration** - How you helped the team

### The Summary Structure
1. Who you are and your main focus
2. What you do well (tools/skills)
3. Proof of impact or contribution
4. What you want next

## Tips for Best Results

- Include your target role or a job description for tailored feedback
- Have your LinkedIn profile handy for consistency checks
- Save final version as PDF when applying (never submit Word docs)
