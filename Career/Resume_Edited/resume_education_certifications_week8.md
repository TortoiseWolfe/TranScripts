## Core Principle

Position education, certifications, and boot camp experience as **evidence of job-relevant skills**, not filler. Recruiters care less about where learning happened and more about **what knowledge was applied**.

Degrees, certifications, and boot camp experience should **support your target role**, not distract from it.

---

## What Recruiters Scan For

Recruiters scan the education section to answer one question quickly: **Does this candidate have relevant applied knowledge for the role I'm hiring for?**

**What recruiters look for:**
- Alignment with the role
- Applied coursework or hands-on learning
- Recent or ongoing skill development
- Credentials that match job requirements

**What recruiters skip:**
- Long course lists with no context
- Irrelevant electives
- Coursework that doesn't support the role
- GPA (unless explicitly requested—don't list it)

---

## Weak vs Strong Examples

**Weak Example:**
> Bachelor of Science in Biology
> Relevant Coursework: Biology 101, Chemistry 201, Physics 110

**Strong Example:**
> Bachelor of Science in Biology
> Relevant Coursework: Data Analysis, Statistical Modeling, Research Methods

The strong version **reframes the same degree** to match analytical and technical roles. You're not rewriting history—you're highlighting what matters.

## How to Structure Education Sections

### Recommended Order
1. **Most relevant or most recent education**
2. **Certifications or technical credentials**
3. **Boot camp or intensive training programs**

### Placement by Career Stage

| Career Stage | Education Placement |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Early career (just out of university) | Above experience, right under summary and skills |
| Career changers | Below summary and skills, at the bottom after experience |
| Experienced professionals | Toward the bottom, unless role-critical |

**Career changers** are often experienced professionals—keep education at the bottom of your resume.

---

## Section Title Options

Use clear, simple titles:
- Education
- Education and Certifications
- Education and Technical Training

**Clarity over creativity.** Keep it simple.

---

## Tailoring Coursework to Target Roles

Your education section should change depending on the role you're targeting. You're not rewriting history—you're **highlighting what matters**.

### How to Choose Coursework to Highlight
1. Look at job descriptions for roles you're applying to
2. Identify required and preferred skills
3. Match coursework that supports those skills

### Role-Specific Relevant Coursework

**For Developers:**
- Data Structures
- Algorithms
- Web Development
- Databases
- API Design

**For QA/Test Engineers:**
- Software Testing
- Debugging
- Test Automation
- SQL
- Systems Design

**For Data/Low-Code Roles:**
- Statistics
- Data Analytics
- SQL
- Python
- Data Visualization

**For Career Changers (Transferable Coursework):**
- Research Methods
- Technical Writing
- Process Optimization
- Analytical Problem Solving

## Adding Achievements

Add achievements when possible:
- Capstone projects
- Final projects
- Team-based work
- Certifications earned

### Boot Camp Example

> **Coding Boot Camp, Full Stack Development**
> Completed a 12-week intensive program focused on JavaScript, React, Node.js, and SQL. Built multiple full-stack applications and completed a final capstone project.

This shows **scope, focus, and applied learning**.

### TechJoy Academy Example (Live Session)

> **TechJoy Academy, Full Stack Development Boot Camp**
> Completed a 7-month boot camp and internship program focused on JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, and SQL. Built full-stack components for multiple client sites, working collaboratively with a team.

**Key elements:**
- Duration and program type
- Technologies/skills learned
- What you built
- Collaboration (soft skill)

---

## Certifications Guidance

**Include certifications if:**
- They are accredited (through a recognized agency)
- They are relevant to your target role

**Skip or minimize:**
- Udemy courses (unless they result in an official certification)
- Non-accredited training without recognized credentials

For systems engineering or similar degrees: **List 3 top relevant coursework items** rather than assuming recruiters know what's involved.

---

## Key Principle

**Education should support your resume, not compete with it.** When tailored correctly, it reinforces your skills and strengthens your story.

**Relevance beats completeness—always.** If it's not relevant to the jobs you're applying to, it doesn't matter.

---

## Homework

1. Update one education entry to match your target role
2. Remove any coursework that doesn't add value
3. Align education language with job descriptions you're applying to
