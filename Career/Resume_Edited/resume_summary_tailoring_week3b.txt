## Handling AI-Generated Content Concerns

### Common Recruiter Concerns
Some recruiters claim they won't look at AI-generated resumes

### Reality Check
- If it hits all the points that are true about your skill set and experience, it works
- The technology is here to use
- Even with AI, crafting a meaningful resume takes time

### Making AI Content Sound Human
1. Remove the em dash (--) and replace with commas
2. Tell ChatGPT: "Do not make what you generate sound like AI. Make it sound human."
3. Take what it produces and add your own voice and flair
4. If using ChatGPT output, be aware of potential watermarks when copying

## Consistency Across Your Assets

When you finalize a summary:

**Your summary should match:**
- LinkedIn headline and about section (tone, not identical)
- Job titles in experience section
- Skills you list
- Roles you actually apply for

### Alignment Problems to Avoid

- Resume summary targets full stack roles but LinkedIn headline says "open to anything" = Confuses recruiters
- Summary lists Python and SQL but skills section doesn't include them = Looks careless

---

## Action Steps

1. Copy your final summary into your LinkedIn about section and adapt it there
2. Check that your target role is the same across resume and LinkedIn profile
3. Check that your top three skills appear in: Summary, Skills section, LinkedIn about, LinkedIn skills

---

## Creating LinkedIn Summary from Resume Summary

### ChatGPT Prompt
```
This is my resume summary.
[paste resume summary]

Create a new summary for my LinkedIn about section.
This new LinkedIn about summary should mirror my resume summary in tone only.
It should not be identical.
```

---

## The Brand Mindset

You are a brand first and foremost.

- LinkedIn = Your storefront (public brand)
- Resume = Your proof document (sales sheet)

Those who understand marketing understand how to present themselves effectively.

---

## Self-Assessment Checklist

- Does my summary state a clear target role?
- Does it list key tools or skills that match real job posts?
- Does it include at least one piece of proof?
- Does it say what I want to do next?
- Can someone skim it in five seconds and understand my direction?

If you answer yes to most, you're in strong shape.

## Key Takeaways

1. You can take a generic summary and adapt it to any specific job posting
2. Tailor by incorporating keywords and requirements from the job description
3. Different summary versions for different job types is smart strategy
4. Resume and LinkedIn should be cohesive but not identical
5. Brand consistency matters - recruiters notice alignment (or lack thereof)
6. Use AI as a tool but add your own voice and verify accuracy
