Resume Series: Keywords & ATS Optimization (Week 4)

---

## Why Keywords Matter

Recruiters search for candidates the same way you search for things online: **Keywords.**

Keywords determine how you show up in searches. This is the bridge between your resume, LinkedIn skills, and job alerts.

**Last week:** Telling your story clearly (summary)
**This week:** Speaking the language that employers are using

---

## Three Types of Resume Keywords

### 1. Technical Skills
Languages, tools, frameworks
- JavaScript, React, Node.js, Python
- PostgreSQL, MongoDB, AWS
- Git, Docker, REST APIs

### 2. Role-Specific Terms
- Front end, backend, full stack
- Test automation, ETL
- REST APIs, microservices

### 3. Soft Skills Tied to Delivery
- Collaboration, communication
- Agile, Sprint planning
- Cross-functional teams

Hiring teams use these terms in job descriptions, recruiter searches, and interview criteria.

## How ATS and Recruiters Use Keywords

- **ATS systems** scan for keywords
- **Recruiters** skim for them clearly and effortlessly

### LinkedIn Alignment
As you put keywords in LinkedIn, your resume keywords should match your LinkedIn skills. This alignment:
- Increases search visibility
- Helps your profile appear in relevant job alerts

---

## Extracting Keywords from Job Descriptions

### What to Look For

1. **Job Title:** Lead Full Stack Engineer, Frontend Developer, etc.
2. **Responsibilities section:** Action words and technologies mentioned
3. **Required Skills/Qualifications:** Must-have technologies and experience
4. **Preferred Skills:** Nice-to-haves that set you apart
5. **Tools in the Stack:** Specific technologies listed

### Keyword Extraction Exercise

For any job description, identify:
- Top 3 technical keywords
- Top 2 role/action keywords
- Top 2 environment keywords
- Any repeated tool or framework

---

## Environment Keywords

Environment keywords describe the setting, pace, or structure of the workplace:

- Fast-paced
- Collaborative
- Agile
- Customer-focused
- Deadline-driven
- Hybrid/On-site/Remote
- High-volume
- Startup vs Enterprise
- Cross-functional
- Mentorship-oriented
- Data-driven
- Product-led

These help match your resume language to the employer's described environment.

---

## Anchor Keywords Strategy

If you have three different jobs you want to apply to:
1. Pull keywords from all three job descriptions
2. Find keywords that appear in all three
3. These are your **anchor keywords**

**Anchor keywords belong in:**
- Your skills section
- Your summary
- Your experience bullets (where relevant)

---

## Integrating Keywords Naturally

Keywords only help if they read naturally. ATS systems and recruiters ignore keyword dumping.

### Clean Integration Methods

**Add tools to your summary:**
"Skilled in React, Node.js, and REST API integration"

**Add keywords to skills section in order of importance:**
React, JavaScript, Node.js, SQL, Git, APIs

**Add keywords into bullets with context:**
"Built REST API endpoints using Node.js and Express"
"Created test cases and automated regression tests using Jest"

**Match terminology exactly:**
If the job description says "TypeScript," don't abbreviate to "TS"

---

## Before and After Examples

### Example 1
**Before:** "Worked on backend routes"
**After:** "Built and tested backend API routes using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB"

### Example 2
**Before:** "Did manual testing"
**After:** "Designed manual test cases and API tests using Postman to validate data accuracy"

---

## Homework: Keyword Integration

1. Choose three job descriptions
2. Extract overlapping keywords
3. Add them to your summary, skills section, and two resume bullets
4. Update your LinkedIn skills to match the same set

---

## Important Reminders

### Resume vs LinkedIn
Your resume and LinkedIn profile should NOT be identical.
- Do not put the same summary in both places
- That's lazy and an immediate pass from recruiters

### The Strategy Recruiters Wish Job Seekers Used
The more you practice keyword work, the more interviews you'll get.

When your keywords match employer language, you immediately increase your chances of passing:
- Recruiter scans
- ATS filters
