Resume Series: The Recruiter's Perspective (Week 1)
https://youtu.be/sGOiktiv6Oo

## Course Overview

Over 12 weeks of LinkedIn strategy, we built visibility. Now we're turning that visibility into proof on paper.

**LinkedIn = Your public brand (storefront)**
**Resume = Your sales sheet (proof document)**

## The 6-Second Scan

When a recruiter opens your resume, they spend **6-10 seconds** on the first scan.

### What Recruiters Look For Immediately
1. **Top third of your resume** - Name, headline, summary
2. **Job titles and company names** - Role progression
3. **Visible metrics or measurable outcomes** - Proof of impact
4. **Keywords that match the role** - Technical skills, tools

### What Makes Recruiters Stop Scrolling
- Clear target role or headline at the top
- Bullets that show outcomes, not tasks
- Consistency between resume and LinkedIn profile

---

## Describing vs Marketing Your Value

**Weak (describing work):**
"Helped with customer emails"

**Strong (marketing value):**
"Resolved 50+ support tickets per week, reducing average response time from 24 hours to 6"

This is the difference between describing your work and marketing your value.

---

## The Bullet Formula

Every bullet should follow this structure:

**Action Verb + Task + Result**

### Examples

**Before:** Worked on website updates
**After:** Improved site load time by 40% through optimized code deployment

**Before:** Responsible for front-end updates
**After:** Improved frontend layout by refactoring components for cleaner, more reusable code

## When You Don't Have Metrics

For boot camp students and early-career developers working on projects without production data:

**The resume will NOT look unbelievable without metrics** - as long as you focus on:
- Evidence of process
- Scope of work
- As much outcome as you know

Recruiters understand that early-career coders and pre-production contributors often don't have production data.

### Impact Logic (Credible Bullets Without Numbers)

**Show Scope Instead of Data:**
- "Developed authentication flow for full-stack MERN app with JWT and React Context"
- "Built six REST API endpoints to handle CRUD operations for product data"

**Show Quality or Improvement:**
- "Improved app reliability by refactoring frontend components for reusable logic"
- "Enhanced code readability and reduced redundancy through modularization"

**Use Frequency or Scale:**
- "Debugged multiple front-end issues weekly in collaboration with QA team"
- "Implemented feature updates across three sprint cycles following agile methodology"

**Emphasize Collaboration and Delivery:**
- "Collaborated with design team to translate wireframes into responsive React components"
- "Participated in code reviews and contributed to team documentation standards"

---

## Boot Camp Project Bullet Examples

**Learning/Boot Camp Projects:**
- "Completed 12-week coding boot camp focused on full-stack JavaScript development"
- "Practiced version control, deployment, and testing in real-time collaborative projects"
- "Presented final capstone project to technical mentors and peers, explaining architecture and decisions"

**Soft Skills:**
- "Balanced multiple project deadlines while maintaining code quality and documentation standards"

## Resume Top Third Checklist

Your top third must include:
- Name, city, email, phone
- LinkedIn URL
- GitHub (if applicable)
- Portfolio (if relevant and applicable)
- Target role line (headline)
- 3-4 line summary that mirrors LinkedIn about section

---

## Homework

1. Take one weak bullet and rewrite it using Action + Task + Result
2. Refine the top third of your resume
3. Include a clear target role line
4. Make sure LinkedIn headline and summary match similar target language (not identical, but aligned)

---

## Key Takeaways

1. Recruiters spend 6-10 seconds on the first scan
2. Your resume is a marketing tool, not a job description
3. Use the formula: Action Verb + Task + Result
4. Recruiters read outcome as proof of ownership, not proof of revenue
5. You demonstrate credibility through clarity of contribution
6. Visibility attracts attention, but proof earns interviews
