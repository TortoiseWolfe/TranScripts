## Resume Structure Recap

### Reverse Chronological Resume
- Most common and preferred for consistent career paths
- Highlights steady progression and recent experience
- Easy for recruiters and ATS systems to read

**Use when:** Staying in the same field, consistent experience and titles

### Functional Resume (Skills-Based)
- Ideal for career changers or those with mixed experience
- Groups experience under skill categories instead of dates
- Highlights transferable skills and impact instead of job titles

**Use when:** Pivoting careers, gaps in employment, mixed experience, rebranding yourself

## Resume Anatomy: Non-Negotiables

**Sections that must appear:**
1. Name and header (LinkedIn, contact info, GitHub if applicable)
2. Summary (2-5 sentences)
3. Core skills / technical stack
4. Experience and/or projects
5. Education and certifications

---

## Formatting Principles

**Keep margins balanced and fonts consistent**
- Consistency with font and formatting is essential
- Line spacing matters for readability
- Clean and polished appearance

**No headshots on resume**
- European and Asian standard, not US
- Distracting and unnecessary

**Avoid design-heavy templates**
- ATS systems can't read complex designs
- Simple = better

**Page length guidance**
- One page unless you have several years of experience
- Two pages acceptable
- Three pages excessive

**Clarity matters more than decoration**

## Building Your Resume Layout

### Think Structure Before Substance
Start with layout, even using placeholder text:
1. Header with name and contact info
2. Summary section (can be gibberish placeholder initially)
3. Skills section
4. Experience section
5. Education section

Get the format right first, then fill in content.

## Condensing Your Resume

### Header Condensation
- Don't write "LinkedIn: [full URL]" - hyperlink the word "LinkedIn"
- Same for Portfolio and GitHub
- Remove redundant labels

### Line Spacing
- Set to single first
- Then customize spacing (3pt after paragraphs works well)
- Apply consistently throughout

### Remove Excessive Bold
- Not everything needs to be bold
- Use bold strategically for section headers and key items

## Managing Employment Gaps

If you have gaps in employment:
- Functional resume can help by emphasizing skills over timeline
- It's acceptable to note reasons (caretaker for loved one, etc.)
- Life is life - recruiters understand

---

## Age Considerations

To avoid age discrimination:
- Do not list experience over 10 years old
- Do not list graduation year from college
- Focus on recent, relevant experience

---

## Key Equations

**Every resume needs structure before substance**

**Clear focused format = Shows recruiters you respect their time**

**Clean design gets you seen, strong content gets you hired**
