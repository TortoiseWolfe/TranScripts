> **Note:** This session features a live resume review with personalized feedback. Examples are from real participant resumes, demonstrating practical application of layout principles.

## Core Principle

Resume layout and design is one of the **fastest ways to improve your resume without rewriting any content**. A clean layout keeps recruiters reading. A cluttered layout makes them stop.

**The goal is not to make your resume look flashy.** The goal is to make your content:
- Easier to read
- Easier to trust
- Easier to remember

**Less is more.** Unless you are a designer, don't put design on your resume. Even if you are a designer—keep it simple.

---

## Critical Rule: No Photos on US Resumes

**Do not put your photo on your resume.** This is a European practice. In the US, don't do it.

If you want to include a photo, place it in your **online portfolio** in the About section—not on your resume, not on GitHub.

---

## How Recruiters Scan Resumes

Recruiters do not read resumes top to bottom—**they scan**.

**Typical scan pattern:**
1. Top third of the page
2. Section headers
3. Job titles and dates
4. First bullet or two under each role

Your layout either **supports the scan or fights it**. If a recruiter has to work to understand your resume, they move on.

## ATS Reality (Applicant Tracking Systems)

When you apply to a role (LinkedIn, Indeed, company career page), your application goes into an **Applicant Tracking System** (ATS). Common systems include:
- Ashby
- Greenhouse
- JobVite
- Workday

**ATS systems read line by line.** They struggle with:
- Tables
- Text boxes
- Graphics
- Complicated column layouts

Even if a resume looks nice to you, it may be **unreadable to software**.

---

## Core Design Rules

### Font
- **Use one font only**
- Stick to: Arial, Calibri, or Helvetica
- Body text: 10.5 to 12 point
- Section headers: slightly larger
- These fonts are readable, professional, and ATS-safe

### Color
- **Black or dark gray text only**
- No colored section headers
- No background shading
- Color distracts from content and breaks scanning patterns

### Formatting
- **Bold** for section headers and job titles
- Avoid italics for large blocks of text
- **No underlines** except for hyperlinks
- Make hyperlinks black (not blue) for ATS compliance

**Bold guides the eye. Colors confuse it.**

### Layout
- **Single column layout**
- Left-aligned text
- Consistent spacing between sections
- Symmetry builds trust
- Inconsistent spacing signals carelessness

---

## Noisy vs Clean Layout

**Noisy Resume (avoid):**
- Two columns
- Icons for phone and email
- Skill bars
- Multiple fonts
- Tight spacing

**Clean Resume (goal):**
- One column
- Clear section headers
- Consistent bullet spacing
- Simple margins

**Which is easier to scan in 5 seconds?** The clean one.

The clean resume lets the content speak. The noisy resume forces the reader to decode the layout first.

**Design should disappear. Content should stand out.**

## File Format Rules

### Editing
- **Use Google Docs** for editing (easier than Word)
- Only use Microsoft Word if you're an expert
- If you don't know how to show non-printing characters in Word, don't use Word

### Submitting
- **Always submit as PDF** unless the posting specifically requests Word
- PDF preserves formatting
- Word documents can be altered easily
- **Never submit:** Screenshots, Canva links

### File Naming
Name your file clearly: `FirstName_LastName_Resume.pdf`

Not: `JP_Resume.pdf` (too vague—many people share initials)

**Clean formatting ensures your content survives the upload.** If you've been submitting Word docs, your content may not have uploaded correctly—and that might be why you were declined.

---

## Resume Builders: Recruiter Perspective

**Avoid resume builders.** Most are trying to:
- Pull your information to solicit you
- Force you into premium upgrades
- Deliver mediocre results

Recruiters can tell when someone used a resume builder or AI (em-dashes, generic phrasing). **It looks amateur and is a buzzkill.**

Tell your own story in your own way. The recruiter screen is about confirming that you can articulate who you are.

---

## What the Recruiter Screen Is Really About

The recruiter screen assesses:
1. **Presentation:** Do you seem put together?
2. **Soft skills:** Even-tempered, confident, thoughtful
3. **Experience level:** How seasoned are you?
4. **Behavioral fit:** Will you fit in the group they're hiring for?

It's about confirming that everything listed on your resume is true from a behavioral standpoint. The hiring manager will dig into technical specifics later.

## Live Editing: Practical Tips

### Show Non-Printing Characters
When editing, enable **View → Show non-printing characters** to see:
- Extra spaces (two spaces, three spaces)
- Paragraph marks
- Line breaks

This reveals formatting issues invisible in normal view.

### Spacing Guidelines
- **Line spacing:** Set to single, then use custom spacing
- **Before/after paragraphs:** 6 points each for consistency
- **Between sections:** Add one blank line
- **Increase line spacing to 1.1 or 1.2** for readability

### Hyperlinks
- Display as text: "Email" or "LinkedIn" or "Portfolio"
- The actual link is embedded—ATS picks it up from your application anyway
- Make link text black, not blue

### Bullets and Dates
- Align all bullets consistently
- Align all dates to the right
- Use the ruler tool in Google Docs to adjust indentation

### Remove Visual Clutter
- No icons or graphics
- No decorative lines between sections
- No skill bars or progress indicators

## Live Demo Feedback [USER's Resume]

**Header format approved:**
- Name
- Headline underneath
- Location (city/state or "Remote"—never full address)
- Contact links

**Don't put your exact address.** It's an identity theft risk. Location or work preference (remote/hybrid) is sufficient.

**Recommended section order:**
1. Summary
2. Technical Skills (ATS wants to see this early)
3. Professional Experience
4. Key Projects
5. Education and Certifications

**Portfolio link tip:** If you have projects listed in the header AND in a projects section, consolidate. Use "Portfolio" as the hyperlink text in the header, then detail projects in their own section.

**Stubborn formatting lines:** If you can't delete a horizontal line, try placing cursor at line end and using backspace, or check if it's a border applied to the paragraph above.

---

## Certifications Q&A

**Include certifications if:**
- Relevant to your target role
- Within the past 3 years (relevance matters more than recency)
- Accredited/recognized

**Course length doesn't matter.** A 6-week intensive is just as valid as a longer program. What matters is relevance to your target roles.

**If you're starting a certification:** List it once you've enrolled or completed it, if it's relevant.

---

## Key Takeaway

**Your resume layout should never compete with your content.** When design is clean, recruiters stay focused on what you've accomplished.

Clean design wins every time.

## Homework

1. Check your resume for: multiple fonts, uneven spacing, crowded margins, inconsistent bullet indentation
2. Remove any visual clutter (icons, graphics, decorative lines)
3. Bring a polished version to the next session
