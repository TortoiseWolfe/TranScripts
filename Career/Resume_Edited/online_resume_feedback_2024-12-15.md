## Critical Issues (Fix First)

### 1. TechJoy Software - Incorrect Dates & Missing Role

**Current (WRONG):**
```
SOFTWARE ENGINEERING INTERN
TechJoy Software | Remote
Jan 2022 - Present | Current
```

**Should Be TWO Separate Entries:**

**Entry A - Internship (past):**
```
SOFTWARE ENGINEERING INTERN
TechJoy Software | Madison, NJ (Remote)
Jan 2022 - Mar 2022

• Built responsive UI components in React and TypeScript for client web applications
• Integrated RESTful APIs following agile methodology
```

**Entry B - Peer Mentor (current):**
```
PEER MENTOR
TechJoy Software | Madison, NJ (Remote)
Nov 2024 - Present | Current

• Guide students through React and TypeScript projects, providing code review and debugging support
• Participate in weekly community learning sessions and help explain best practices for web development
```

**Why it matters:** Showing an internship as "current" for 3 years looks like a data error to recruiters. The Peer Mentor role demonstrates continued relationship and mentorship skills.

### 2. Resume Summary - Missing "What's Next" Sentence

**Current ending:**
> "Maintains 166+ GitHub repositories including full stack templates with 93 components and 680+ tests."

**Add this sentence to the end:**
```
Seeking full stack or automation-focused roles where I can build tools that solve real workflow problems for development teams.
```

**Why it matters:** The 4-line summary formula from coaching says Line 4 should signal what you're looking for. Without it, recruiters don't know your target role.

## Medium Priority Issues

### 3. Projects Section - Swap "House that Code Built" for "TurtleWolfe.com"

**Current projects:**
1. SpokeToWork ✓
2. ScriptHammer Template ✓
3. Interactive Resume ✓
4. The House that Code Built ← Replace this

**Replace with TurtleWolfe.com:**
```
TurtleWolfe.com
https://turtlewolfe.com/
Since 2012

Portfolio site showcasing custom apps for small companies. Features mobile-first responsive design. Highlights full stack development with Node, React, Docker, AWS, and Google Cloud, plus 3D/AR work with C# and Unity.

Skills: React.js, Node.js, Docker, AWS, Responsive Web Design
```

### 4. Trinam Location - Expand from "GA"

**Current:** `Trinam Drafting and Design | GA`
**Change to:** `Trinam Drafting and Design | Alpharetta, GA` (or actual city)

---

## Quick Fix Checklist

```
[x] Projects section - swap House that Code Built for TurtleWolfe.com
[x] Trinam location - expand GA to full city
[ ] Split TechJoy into two entries (Intern Jan-Mar 2022, Peer Mentor Nov 2024-Present)
[ ] Add "what's next" sentence to summary
```
