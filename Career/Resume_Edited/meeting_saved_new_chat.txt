	You can measure:
	 • Frequency. How often did you do something
	 • Volume. How many items, users, tickets, pages, or features
	 • Time. How long something took or how much time you helped save.
	 • Scope. Size of the project or team.
	 • Reach. Number of people who used what you built or supported.”
	
2025-12-03 18:15:09 From 6 Figure Coding Coach to Everyone:
	Frequency examples:
	 • “Joined daily standups and completed two to three tickets per sprint.”
	 • “Ran manual test passes on each release before deployment.”
	
2025-12-03 18:15:53 From 6 Figure Coding Coach to Everyone:
	Volume examples:
	 • “Built six reusable React components for shared layouts.”
	 • “Wrote 20+ unit tests to cover core functions.”
	 • “Supported 50+ customer orders per week in a part-time retail role.”
	
2025-12-03 18:16:27 From 6 Figure Coding Coach to Everyone:
	Scope examples:
	 • “Collaborated with a team of four developers on a full-stack project.”
	 • “Maintained data for a product catalog of 200+ items.”
	
2025-12-03 18:17:00 From 6 Figure Coding Coach to Everyone:

	 • “Created a tutorial that classmates referenced during a group project.”
	
2025-12-03 18:21:00 From 6 Figure Coding Coach to Everyone:
	Take three minutes and write down three raw metrics from your experience.
	
2025-12-03 18:22:09 From 6 Figure Coding Coach to Everyone:
	About how many features, pages, or components have you built?
	 • About how many users, tickets, or customers have you supported?
	 • About how many projects, sprints, or group assignments have you completed?”
	
2025-12-03 18:25:16 From Turtle Wolfe to Everyone:
	I'm sure I can come up with better ones later, but first draftScriptHammer has over 33 features,I've created over a thousand react components (generous estimate)my git hub has 108 repos
	
2025-12-03 18:25:52 From 6 Figure Coding Coach to Everyone:
	Now we apply the formula: Action Verb + Task + Result (with metric if possible).
	
2025-12-03 18:27:12 From 6 Figure Coding Coach to Everyone:
	Template 1:
	 “[Action verb] [what you worked on] for [how many / how often] to [result or purpose].”
	Template 2:
	 “[Action verb] [number] [items/features/tickets] in [time frame], which [result / supported outcome].”
	Template 3:
	 “[Action verb] [task], handling [volume or frequency] to support [team, users, or project].”
