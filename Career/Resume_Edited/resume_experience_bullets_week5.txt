Resume Series: Experience Bullets (Week 5)

---

## Why Experience Bullets Matter

Your experience bullets are one of the most important parts of your resume. This is where recruiters look first to see your value.

**Goal:** Learn how to turn basic duties into strong accomplishments that prove impact.

---

## Strong Bullets vs Weak Bullets

**Weak bullets list tasks.**
**Strong bullets show why the task mattered.**

Recruiters skim resumes - they don't read every bullet. They look for short, clear statements that show outcomes.

### Three Qualities of Strong Bullets
1. Start with a clear action verb
2. Explain what you worked on
3. Show the outcome or value of your work

---

## The Bullet Formula

**Action Verb + Task + Result**

This formula changes everything. Every experience bullet should follow this structure.

---

## Examples with Metrics

**Action verb + Task + Result (with metric):**
"Developed API endpoints using Node.js to support user profile management"

---

## Writing Strong Bullets Without Metrics

Most early career coders don't have production metrics. That's normal. You can still show impact using:

### 1. Scope
What was the scale of your work? Size of project, number of components, number of features, technologies used.

**Example:** "Built three interactive pages using React JSX and API data integration"

### 2. Consistency
How often did you do this task?

**Example:** "Tested API responses daily using Postman to ensure consistent data validation"

### 3. Quality or Improvement
Did your work make something cleaner, faster, clearer, easier?

**Example:** "Improved code readability by modularizing business logic across components"

### 4. Collaboration and Delivery
How did you help the team?

**Example:** "Supported sprint delivery by completing assigned tickets and participating in code reviews"

---

## More Examples Using the Formula

### If You Lack Metrics
"Built React components that improved code readability and simplified feature updates"

### Using Scope Instead of Data
"Collaborated with a team of four developers to design and deliver core project features"

### Using Frequency
"Debugged multiple front-end issues weekly across different browsers and devices"

### Using Improvement Language
"Enhanced application stability by resolving API integration errors"

**All five versions are valid and believable.** Impact doesn't always require numbers - it requires clarity.

---

## Before and After Rewrites

### Example 1
**Before:** "Responsible for helping with front-end updates"
**After:** "Improved frontend layout by refactoring components for cleaner, more reusable code"

### Example 2
**Before:** "Worked on backend routes"
**After:** "Built and tested backend API routes using Node.js and Express to support user authentication"

**Why the "After" works:**
- Uses action verbs
- Describes what you built
- Shows the purpose of the work

---

## Live Rewrite Exercise

**Before:** "Educational platform template reducing redundancies"

**After:** "Built a full stack template to standardize project setup and cut redundant tasks, improving development speed"

**Breakdown:**
- **Action verb:** Built
- **Task:** full stack template to standardize project setup and cut redundant tasks
- **Result:** improving development speed

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Listing Technologies Without Context
**Weak:** Just listing "React, Node.js, PostgreSQL"
**Strong:** Use technologies within action-oriented bullets

### Describing What Something Is Instead of What You Did
A bullet should show what YOU did, not describe the project

### Overthinking Without Starting
Don't look at your entire resume - focus on one bullet at a time. Break it down day by day if needed.

---

## Working with AI for Bullets

### Using ChatGPT
```
Using the formula: Action verb + Task + Result
Rewrite the following bullet:
[paste your weak bullet]
```

### Tips for Better AI Results
- Be specific with your prompts
- Provide context about who you are
- Tell it: "Do not sound like a robot. Be human. Warm but professional."
- If results aren't perfect, refine your prompt or edit manually

---

## Showing Business Impact

Bullets aren't about job function - they're about showing how you can impact business.

**Ask yourself:** How am I showing value here?

**What recruiters respond to:**
- Clarity
- Results
- Unwavering ownership

---

## Career Changers and Entry-Level

Just because you worked on a specific project doesn't mean it has to go on your resume.
- If you're not proud of the project, don't list it
- One or two exciting projects is more impactful than many mediocre ones

For career changers:
- Leverage your previous experience (QA, customer service, etc.)
- Show transferable skills through the bullet formula
- Be humble but confident about where you're starting

---

## Portfolio and GitHub Alignment

If you have a portfolio or GitHub:
- Make sure bullets match the language in your project descriptions
- There should be cohesive flow between resume and project showcases

**Priority order for early career:**
1. Resume first
2. GitHub second
3. Portfolio later (when you have produced work)

---

## Homework

1. Look at your bullets one by one
2. Take a day per bullet if needed - don't rush
3. Update three bullets on your resume using the formula
4. Keep the formula close: Action Verb + Task + Result
5. If you have GitHub, ensure bullets match project description language

---

## Key Takeaways

1. Weak bullets list tasks; strong bullets show why tasks mattered
2. Follow the formula: Action Verb + Task + Result
3. Without metrics, use: Scope, Consistency, Quality/Improvement, Collaboration
4. Impact doesn't require numbers - it requires clarity
5. Break down the work: one bullet at a time
6. Show business impact, not job function
7. Recruiters respond to clarity, results, and ownership
8. AI can help, but add your own voice and verify accuracy
9. Quality over quantity - better to have fewer strong bullets than many weak ones
