## Why Format Matters

If a recruiter can't navigate your resume in 6 seconds, they won't.

Recruiters scan for:
- Clarity
- Structure
- Alignment with the role

The format should guide their eyes, not overwhelm them.

## Two Core Resume Structures

### 1. Reverse Chronological Resume
**Best for:** Consistent career paths (staying in same industry)

- Most common and preferred format
- Highlights steady progression and recent experience
- Easy for recruiters and ATS systems to read
- Lists experience in date order (most recent first)

**Use when:**
- Staying in the same industry
- Have consistent experience and titles
- Want to showcase steady growth

### 2. Functional Resume (Skills-Based)
**Best for:** Career changers or those with mixed experience

- Groups experience under skill categories instead of dates
- Highlights transferable skills and impact instead of job titles
- Ideal for pivoting careers or rebranding

**Use when:**
- Pivoting careers (teacher becoming developer, etc.)
- Have gaps or mixed experience
- Need to highlight skills before timeline

**Recommendation for TechJoy students:** Functional resume (most are career changers)

## Resume Anatomy: Non-Negotiable Sections

### 1. Header
- Name (prominent)
- LinkedIn profile link
- Contact information (email, phone)
- GitHub (for developers)
- Portfolio link (if applicable - produced work you have permission to showcase)

### 2. Headline
- Clear target role
- Goes directly under your name
- Example: "Full Stack Developer | React | Node | PostgreSQL"

### 3. Summary
- 2-5 sentences maximum
- Mirrors LinkedIn about section (similar, not identical)
- Tailored to your goals

### 4. Core Skills / Technical Stack
- Listed right under summary
- ATS systems and AI parse resumes for these keywords
- Organize by category if needed

### 5. Experience and/or Projects
- Use Action + Task + Result formula
- Most recent first
- 3-5 bullets per position

### 6. Education and Certifications
- List at the bottom
- Include boot camps and relevant training

## Formatting Best Practices

### Do
- Keep margins balanced
- Use consistent fonts throughout
- Maintain consistent line spacing (single, then customize)
- Stick to one page unless you have several years of experience (two pages acceptable, three excessive)
- Use simple, clean design
- Save as PDF when submitting (never Word - can be altered)

### Don't
- Put your photograph on your resume (European standard, not US)
- Use design-heavy templates (ATS systems can't read them)
- Use various colors or graphics (distracting)
- Make the name huge
- Include headers/footers that might be missed

---

## Resume Tailoring Process

1. Keep a master template in Google Docs/Sheets
2. For each application: File → Make a Copy
3. Tailor the copy for that specific job
4. File → Download → PDF
5. Never send Word documents

## Live Formatting Tips

### Hyperlinks
- Don't write "LinkedIn: [full URL]"
- Instead: Hyperlink the word "LinkedIn" to your profile
- Same for Portfolio and GitHub

### Line Spacing
- Always set to single first
- Then customize (try 3pt after paragraphs)
- Consistency is key

### Font Size
- Keep headlines consistent (all same size)
- Body text: 10-12pt typically
- Name can be slightly larger
