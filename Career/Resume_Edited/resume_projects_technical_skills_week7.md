## Why Projects Matter

This is one of the most powerful sections of your resume as a developer. Your **projects and technical experience** often determines whether a recruiter believes you can actually do the work.

- Titles and summaries get attention
- **Projects earn trust**

### Session Goals

- Know where projects belong on your resume
- Write clean, scannable project descriptions
- Link GitHub and portfolios the right way
- Align resume projects with LinkedIn projects

## What Recruiters Look For

When recruiters review projects, they are **not judging perfection**. They're looking for evidence of:

- **Thinking**
- **Execution**
- **Ownership**

### The Four Questions

Strong project sections answer these four questions quickly:

1. **What did you build?**
2. **What tools did you use?**
3. **What problem did you solve?**
4. **What part did you personally own?**

### Weak vs Strong Examples

**Weak example:**
> Built a MERN stack project using React, Node, and MongoDB.

This lists tools with no context.

**Strong example:**
> Built a full stack MERN application that allows users to create and manage accounts, integrating React state management with REST APIs and MongoDB persistence.

**Same tools, completely different level of credibility.**

Breaking down the strong example:
- **What did you build?** Full stack MERN application
- **What tools did you use?** REST APIs, React, MongoDB
- **What problem did it solve?** Allows users to create and manage accounts

## Where Projects Belong on Your Resume

**Placement matters.**

### For Early Career Developers

If you are an early career developer, boot camp grad, or career changer:

- Projects should appear **near the top** of your resume
- Place them **right after your summary and/or skills**

### For Experienced Developers

If you have professional engineering experience:

- Projects can live under a **Technical Experience** section
- Or be **integrated into your job bullets**

**Projects should never be buried or treated like an afterthought.**

---

## Section Naming

Acceptable section titles for your projects:

- Projects
- Technical Projects
- Selected Projects
- Technical Experience

**Choose clarity over creativity.**

---

## How to Write Strong Project Entries

Every project should be written in **two parts**:

**Line 1:** Project name + one-line description of what it does

**Line 2:** Tools used + what you specifically built or implemented

Two lines, clean, scannable, **no paragraphs**.

---

## Project Examples

### Example 1: Full Stack - Task Tracker Application

> **Task Tracker Application**
> Built a full stack task management app allowing users to create, edit, and delete tasks. Implemented React components, Node.js APIs, and MongoDB data storage.

### Example 2: Front End - Portfolio Site

> **Portfolio Site**
> Designed and developed a responsive personal portfolio using React and CSS Grid, showcasing projects and GitHub repositories.

### Example 3: Backend - Authentication API

> **Authentication API**
> Created REST API endpoints for user authentication using Node.js, Express, and JWT, including error handling and validation.

### Example 4: QA Testing - API Test Suite

> **API Test Suite**
> Developed manual and automated API tests using Postman and Jest to validate request and response handling.

This format shows **scope, stack, and ownership**. It gives recruiters confidence without overwhelming them.

## Links Best Practices

Your resume should include:

- **GitHub link** at the top (required for developers)
- **Portfolio link** if you have one
- **Optional GitHub link** directly under key projects if relevant

### Formatting Links

- **Do not** paste long URLs
- Use clean hyperlink text like "GitHub Repository" or "Live Demo"
- Hyperlink the project name directly to the project URL

### Repository Standards

- Only link projects you're proud of
- Repos should have **clear README files**
- Code should be readable, even if unfinished
- **Commit history matters more than polish**
- Ensure links are not broken
- Everything should be explained properly

---

## Resume and LinkedIn Alignment

Your resume projects **must match** your LinkedIn project section.

- Same project names
- Same tools
- Same descriptions

When recruiters click from your resume to LinkedIn, they should see the **same story reinforced**.

---

## The "Why" Factor

When describing projects, don't just list what you built and the tools used. Include **why it matters**:

- Who does it benefit?
- Whose problem does it solve?
- Why is this important?

This transforms a technical description into a compelling story.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Projects are not filler—**they're proof**
- When written clearly, projects tell recruiters:
  - You can apply what you've learned
  - You understand the stack
  - You can ship work
- Being able to **talk about your work fluently** is critical for technical interviews

---

## Homework

1. Add or refine at least **two projects** on your resume
2. Update your **LinkedIn project section** to match
3. Ensure your **GitHub links** are clean and readable
