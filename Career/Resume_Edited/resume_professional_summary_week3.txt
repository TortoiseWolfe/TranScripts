## What a Professional Summary Is and Is Not

### A Summary Is NOT
- An objective statement like "to obtain a role where I can grow"
- A generic list of soft skills
- A paragraph packed with buzzwords with no proof

### A Summary IS
- A short, focused snapshot of your value
- Aligned to a specific role or role family
- Written in language that recruiters use in job descriptions
- Backed by real work, projects, or skills

---

## Why This Matters

In today's market, a recruiter might review hundreds of résumés for one role.

- If your summary sounds generic, they move on
- If your summary sounds targeted and confident, they keep reading

Your summary should connect with your LinkedIn about section. Not identical, but cohesive. If your summary says one thing and your LinkedIn says something completely different, that hurts trust.

## The Professional Summary Structure

Use this formula every time (3-5 sentences max):

**Line 1:** Who you are and your main focus
**Line 2:** What you do well, including tools or skills
**Line 3:** Proof of impact or contribution
**Line 4-5:** What you want next and how you want to add value

## Example Summaries

### Junior Full Stack Developer
1. Full stack developer with training in JavaScript, React, and Node.js
2. Builds end-to-end features, connects APIs, and writes clean testable code
3. Delivered multiple boot camp and personal projects using Git, REST APIs, and SQL
4. Seeking a software engineer role where I can contribute to real product features and grow within a collaborative team

### Career Changer into QA/SDET
1. QA engineer transitioning from customer support into test automation and quality focus
2. Skilled in manual testing, SQL queries, and API testing with Postman
3. Improved defect reporting and collaboration between support and dev teams in previous roles
4. Targeting QA and SDET roles where quality metrics and automated tests support reliable releases

### Data/Analytics Focused
1. Data analyst with experience in SQL, spreadsheets, and data visualization
2. Collects, cleans, and analyzes data sets to answer concrete business questions
3. Built dashboards and reports that helped stakeholders see trends and patterns more clearly
4. Targeting data roles where I can support decision-making with clear analysis

## Weak vs Strong Summary Comparison

**Weak Example:**
"Motivated developer looking for an opportunity to grow and learn. Hard worker and team player who loves technology."

**Problems:**
- No tech stack
- No specific role target
- No proof of work
- Generic fluff that says nothing

**Strong Example:**
"Frontend developer with training in React, JavaScript, and responsive design. Builds accessible, mobile-friendly interfaces and collaborates closely with designers. Completed multiple projects using REST APIs and Git. Targeting junior front-end roles where I can ship features that improve user experience."

**Why It Works:**
- Names the role clearly
- Lists the tech stack
- Provides proof of work
- Explains target clearly

## Tailoring Your Summary

For career changers with transferable skills:
- Focus on what translates to tech (problem-solving, following documentation, team collaboration)
- Previous career experience shows up in your work history - summary should focus on where you're going
- Transferable skills matter but keep summary focused on target role

## Tightening Your Summary

**Remove:**
- Repeated phrases like "hard worker" and "team player" (unless you give proof)
- Filler like "seeking an opportunity where I can grow and learn"

**Keep:**
- The role
- The stack
- The outcomes
- The target
