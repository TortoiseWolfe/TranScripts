# Adding Metrics and Numbers to Your Resume

## Why Recruiters Scan for Metrics

When recruiters read your resume, they want two things fast:
- **What you did**
- **How much it mattered**

Numbers give a quick picture of impact. Adjectives don't give impact—they beat around the bush.

**Compare these examples:**

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| Responsible for testing features | Tested 3 features per sprint and logged bugs before release |
| Helped customers with questions | Supported 20-30 customer requests each week by email and chat |

The second version feels more real. It gives scope and rhythm.

**Recruiters scan for metrics because numbers show:**
- Scale
- Consistency
- Trust and responsibility

Your job is to tell the truth and make the scale visible.

## 5 Types of Metrics (Even for Non-Numeric Roles)

You don't need sales numbers or corporate dashboards. You can measure:

| Type | What It Measures | Example |
|------|------------------|---------|
| **Frequency** | How often you did something | Joined daily standups and completed 2-3 tickets per sprint |
| **Volume** | How many items, users, tickets, pages, features | Built 6 reusable React components for shared layouts |
| **Time** | How long something took or time saved | Reduced form submission time by simplifying validation logic |
| **Scope** | Size of the project or team | Maintained a product list of 200+ items for team reference |
| **Reach** | Number of people who used what you built | Built a dashboard used by classmates and instructors to track progress |

**If you can count it, you can probably use it as a metric.**

## How to Estimate Numbers Honestly

Sometimes you don't have exact numbers. That's normal. You can still estimate.

**How to estimate honestly:**

1. Think about a normal week or sprint
2. Ask yourself: How many tickets, customers, pages, or tasks do I usually handle?
3. Pick a range that feels realistic
4. Use language that signals an estimate

**Estimation language:**
- About
- Around
- Roughly
- X to Y (ranges)

**Examples with honest estimation:**
- Supported roughly 15-20 customer requests per week
- Reviewed 2-3 pull requests per sprint
- Tested around 5 key user flows per release

This phrasing is common and reasonable. It gives recruiters a sense of scale without pretending you tracked every single instance.

**The rule is simple:** Don't guess wildly. Think through your typical workload and choose a grounded range.

## 3 Bullet Templates

### Template 1: Action + What + Quantity + Result
```
[Action verb] + [what you worked on] + [for how many/how often] + [to result/purpose]
```
**Example:** Built 6 reusable React components that streamlined the layout across main pages

### Template 2: Action + Number + Items + Timeframe + Outcome
```
[Action verb] + [number] + [items/features/tickets] + [in time frame] + [which resulted in/supported outcome]
```
**Example:** Completed 2-4 tickets per month for TechJoy Academy clients using Next.js, JavaScript, CSS, and TypeScript to improve site performance

### Template 3: Action + Task + Volume + Beneficiary
```
[Action verb] + [task] + [handling volume/frequency] + [to support team/users/project]
```
**Example:** Handled 20-25 customer support tickets each week through email and chat

## Bullet Examples with Metrics

- **Built** 6 reusable React components that streamlined the layout across the main pages
- **Handled** 20-25 customer support tickets each week through email and chat
- **Tested** 3 features per sprint and logged bugs before release to reduce issues in production
- **Reviewed** 2-3 pull requests per week and suggested changes to improve code clarity
- **Maintained** a product list of 200+ items in a shared spreadsheet for team reference
- **Implemented** 8 Cypress tests for the sign-in flow to increase test coverage

## Quick Fixes for Your Resume

| Change This | To This |
|-------------|---------|
| "Worked on" | "Built" or "Implemented" |
| Generic verbs | Specific action verbs |
| Missing tech stack | Name the technologies used |
| No beneficiary | Clarify who benefited (user, team, customer, instructor) |

**Ask yourself about each bullet:**
- Which bullets can gain a number?
- Which bullets can gain a frequency or range?
- Which bullets can gain a time or speed element?

---

## Homework

1. **Add at least one metric** to every experience section on your resume
2. **Aim for 3-5 strong quantified bullets**
3. **Update your LinkedIn** experience descriptions with the same numbers so your story matches across platforms

---

## Key Takeaways

- Numbers tell your story faster than any adjective
- Recruiters scan for metrics because metrics show scale and trust
- You don't need perfect data—you need honest, reasonable numbers that bring your work to life
- **Data sells competence. Use numbers to make your results undeniable.**

## Resume-LinkedIn Alignment

Experience bullets underneath each role should mirror between your resume and LinkedIn profile. Keep your story consistent across platforms.
