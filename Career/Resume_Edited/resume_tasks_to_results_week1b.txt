## Mindset Shift

Your resume is not a list of jobs - it's a marketing document.

## Writing Credible Bullets Without Metrics

Tech recruiters confirm: Resumes without hard metrics will NOT prevent you from getting interviews if you focus on:
- Evidence of process
- Scope
- Outcome (as much as you know)

### What Recruiters Want to See: Impact Logic

**1. Show Scope Instead of Data**
- "Developed authentication flow for full-stack MERN app with JWT and React Context"
- "Built six REST API endpoints to handle CRUD operations for product data"

*Scope shows technical depth.*

**2. Show Quality or Improvement Language**
- "Improved app reliability by refactoring frontend components for reusable logic"
- "Enhanced code readability and reduced redundancy through modularization"

*Recruiters recognize these as measurable improvements even without percentages.*

**3. Use Frequency or Scale When Exact Numbers Aren't Tracked**
- "Debugged multiple front-end issues weekly in collaboration with QA team"
- "Implemented feature updates across three sprint cycles following agile methodology"

**4. Emphasize Collaboration and Delivery**
- "Collaborated with design team to translate wireframes into responsive React components"
- "Contributed to sprint planning and participated in daily standups using agile methodology"

**5. Show Results in Terms of Learning or Contribution**
- "Quickly ramped up on new codebase and began contributing within first sprint"
- "Supported senior developer in debugging production issues, reducing resolution time"

**6. Use Project or Course Outcomes**
Boot camp and personal project outcomes still count:
- "Completed 12-week coding boot camp focused on full-stack JavaScript development"
- "Presented final capstone project to technical mentors, explaining architecture decisions"

---

## Bottom Line

**Recruiters read outcome as proof of ownership, not proof of revenue.**

You demonstrate credibility through clarity of contribution.

## Early-Stage Coder Resume Bullets

### Learning/Boot Camp Projects
- "Completed 12-week coding boot camp focused on full-stack JavaScript development"
- "Practiced version control, deployment, and testing in real-time collaborative projects"
- "Presented final capstone project to technical mentors and peers, explaining architecture and decisions"

### Optional Soft Skill Bullets
- "Balanced multiple project deadlines while maintaining code quality and documentation standards"

---

## Adapting Bullets to Your Resume

1. Swap in your own project names (task tracker app, weather dashboard, ecommerce API)
2. Use your tech stack language (React, Vue, Flask, etc.)
3. Replace broad verbs like "built" with context verbs: implemented, integrated, refactored, deployed
4. Keep every bullet under two lines - concise, scannable, results-oriented

---

## The Bullet Formula

**Action Verb + Task + Result**

### Live Rewrite Example

**Before:** "Led development of admin data management feature to improve relevance and timeliness of displayed data"

**After:** "Developed React admin dashboard integrated with AWS S3 to provide full data visibility and manipulation"

---

## Resume Structure Reminder

**Top Third (Most Critical Area):**
- Name, city, email, phone, LinkedIn URL, GitHub, portfolio (if relevant)
- Target role line (headline): "Full Stack Developer | React | Node | API Integration"
- 3-4 line summary that mirrors LinkedIn about section

**Skills Section:**
Should be near the top, underneath summary. ATS systems and AI within applicant tracking systems parse resumes for keywords.

---

## Brand Word Integration

Think of 2-3 words that describe you. Make sure these words show up in your bullets and summary.

### Examples

**If your word is "organized":**
"Streamlined project workflow to reduce task overlap"

**If your word is "technical":**
"Developed REST API integrations improving data flow accuracy"

**If your word is "collaborative":**
"Partnered with three cross-functional teams to deliver feature releases"

---

## Homework

1. Finalize your top third and first five bullets
2. Skills section should be at the top underneath your summary
3. Use the Action + Task + Result formula for every bullet

---

## Key Takeaways

1. Your resume should sound like you and reflect your professional brand
2. Focus on scope, quality, frequency, collaboration - not just metrics
3. Boot camp and project work counts as legitimate experience
4. Clarity of contribution > hard metrics
5. Keep bullets under two lines
6. Match resume language to LinkedIn (similar, not identical)
