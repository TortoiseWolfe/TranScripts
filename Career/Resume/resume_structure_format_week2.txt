Career Strategy w/ Chelsea - Resume Series: Structure & Format (Week 2)
https://youtu.be/uLGKKcpM9gQ

Hey there, David. Just waiting for a few
other people to join.
>> Sounds good.
[clears throat]
Hey there. Just waiting for a few others
to join.
Okay,
I will begin. How are both of you today?
I'm doing good. How are you doing?
>> Oh, good. Good. I just wanted to make
sure you both can hear me.
All right.
>> So, welcome. Thank you for joining me
this evening. Um hopefully we'll have a
couple other people joining. But um you
know tonight we've you know we've been
spending the the last several weeks uh
covering LinkedIn strategy and the
importance of positioning yourself for
visibility. So last week we started
diving into the resume and now we're
shifting into,
you know, the next major tool and
continuing that shift which is your
resume. So tonight we're going to be
focusing on structure
and format because if a recruiter can't
navigate your resume in six seconds,
they won't.
Right.
>> Yeah.
So this evening the focus is really
going to be on um layout and and the
difference between
reverse chronological
versus a functional resume and
understanding
resumeé formats and when to use each.
So, the goal is really going to be for
you to understand the difference between
resumeé structures,
when to use them, and how formatting
impacts a recruiter's readability.
So,
recruiters scan résumés within six to 10
seconds, and we talked about that last
week as well. They look for clarity.
They look for structure
and alignment with the role that they're
recruiting for.
The format should guide their eyes,
not overwhelm them.
And there does need to be some sort of a
cohesive
design sensibility
from font size
to the font that you're using
to really keeping it simple.
No photographs on your resume.
Europe is definitely a place where that
is standard. Not here in the US. It's
not something that we do and it is a
huge discre distraction when people put
their photograph on their resume.
Um
various colors design
also quite distracting. So it's really
about keeping things simple.
Now
there are two
core structures
when using a resume or when uh when
crafting a resume and identifying it.
There's the reverse
chronological
order.
Now, this is most common and preferred
for consistent career paths. So when
you're not changing career path, when
you're looking for a position in the
field that you've been working for a
while consistently,
the reverse chronological
resume
highlights steady progression
and recent experience.
for recruiters and applicant tracking
systems.
Uh,
sorry.
One moment.
Can you hear me?
>> Yeah, I can hear you.
>> Okay.
>> Yep. My headset just dipped out so I had
to reattach it. So sorry for that.
>> You got quiet for a minute but now I can
hear you better.
>> Yeah. So the let me repeat that. So the
reverse chronological
structured resume. The last thing I
mentioned was it is easy for recruiters
and at applicant tracking systems to
read. Now
there is the functional structure resume
and that is what I have mainly
been suggesting for all of you at
Joy of Coding to use. mainly because the
majority of you are career shifters
and
the
functional
skillsbased
resume is ideal for career changers or
those with mixed experience.
Hey Keith,
welcome.
Um, I was just diving in and we were
talking about what we're going to be
covering
this evening. Um, and we are moving
towards focusing on formatting,
structuring your resume and the
difference between reverse chronological
versus functional résumés.
So,
my headset was bobbing in and out, so
I'll repeat again. Um,
the reverse chronological
structured resume is most common and
preferred for consistent career paths.
They it it highlights steady progression
and re recent experience and it is very
easy for recruiters and applicant
tracking systems to read. Now moving
into the functional resume which I was
explaining I have been recommending
mostly for students to use um at TechJoy
because it is ideal for career changers
or those with mixed experience.
It groups experience
under skill categories
instead of dates.
and it highlights
transferable skills and impact instead
of job titles.
So it I can
Would it be helpful if you all saw
examples of that?
>> Yes, that'd be awesome.
Okay.
So, I'm going to go ahead
and I'm going to pull up my own resume
here.
All right.
There's this one
because I have a few different ones.
Isn't that cool?
desktop.
What's that here?
I don't know if I have my
All right, this may take a moment of
digging.
Give me just a moment for me to get into
my Google Drive here.
Actually, this would make it easier.
I think it's coming up here.
Yep, this is a better one. All right,
so let me share my screen.
I think that's it.
All right. Can you guys see my screen?
Yes. Okay. Here
is my chronological
resume.
Now, it doesn't have my header,
but Zoom doesn't like it. Oh, wait.
There it is. But as you can see,
I do have areas of expertise
and a very short sort of summary.
This is what I had. This is the resume I
was using probably last year where I had
like 10 plus years and you know it was a
little bit more um indepth.
I also pulled
some of the recommendations that I had
on LinkedIn and added them
in uh different places in my resume. But
it is professional experience with dates
all chronolog uh chronological order.
Quite long to be honest.
But this is just an example of the
reverse chronological resume.
I had additional experience here.
and then
uh my education and certifications.
Okay, now
let me get back.
Okay, there we go.
And now here's an example
of a functional resume.
Super simple,
super clean, right?
I've got my
professional resume,
my core competencies,
and now
functional experience. Okay, this really
talks about what I've done and what I
can do.
Recruiting strategy, talent branding,
creative and marketing recruitment,
process improvement, technology
utilization,
candidate and client experience
with my professional experience listed
here
as well as education and certifications.
Okay,
put you down here.
Okay, so
when are you using each format?
Reverse chronological
is again when you're staying in the same
industry,
you have consistent experience and
titles
and you want to showcase steady growth.
Now
functional resume
is when you're pivoting careers. Let's
say you're a teacher becoming a
developer.
You use a functional resume when you
have gaps or mixed experiences.
And you need to highlight skills before
the timeline.
That is when you use a functional
resume.
So,
what I'd like for the three of you to do
is identify
which structure
fit fits your current path.
If you're staying in the same field, you
might want to use the reverse
chronological.
If you're pivoting or rebranding
functional resume.
Yeah, exactly right, Timothy. Exactly.
Kind of impressed that you're a
pharmarmacist. I have to say it's pretty
pretty cool.
So,
what's your biggest challenge with your
current resume format?
Let's think about that for a second,
right? And think about what
structure fits your career path.
Now,
let's talk about
resumeé anatomy, right? And the
non-negotiables
sections that must appear in your
resume. And we've talked about this a
bit last week, but we're we're getting
in a little bit deeper each week.
Header.
Now your header is your name and you
need to show your header with your
LinkedIn profile that link
and your contact information.
Now for all of you, GitHub
is something else that I would include
if you have one.
And of course, if you're at the point
where
maybe you've been working as a developer
for, you know, let's say two to five
years and you've got some produced work
that you've been given permission to
highlight
and you want to highlight that in a
portfolio,
you would also list that portfolio link
as well.
summary. We've talked about that. We
talked about that quite a bit last week.
Say,
I think people feel like two to three
sentence max, but I think you could go
for a little bit more if you feel
inclined.
Core skills in your technical stack
100%.
It's a non-negotiable
experience
or projects.
Again,
got to have it.
Then your education and certifications.
If you have certifications, definitely
list them.
Now,
keep your margins balanced and your
fonts consistent. Okay?
you
again.
Yes, you can play around with the font
size, maybe making your name and and
aspects of your header um a little bit
larger than the rest of the text,
but
keep it simple. The name doesn't need to
be huge.
No photographs
of no head shot, nothing like that.
and avoid designheavy
templates that ATS systems cannot read.
designheavy templates with graphics,
various color, that's going to distract
the applicant tracking systems and the
AI prompts that pull the skills
that and competencies that you list. So,
you want to make sure that your resume
passes that test.
Stick
if you can
stick to one page unless you have
oodles of relevant experience that you
need to to list.
Sometimes it needs to be two. Again, it
can be three pages, but this is someone
who's got uh a broad breadth of
experience.
Designheavy might be okay if you're
trying for a design firm.
No, because
>> I know they're just playing around.
That's all.
>> Okay.
>> Oh, you don't want [laughter] any
design? Oh, let me show you how I can
design my resume.
>> I mean,
I I've hired designers and creatives a a
good amount. And
um I think that Yes.
If they're including their resume in
their uh design portfolio, sure you can
make that more creative and designy, but
the resume that you submit in your
application,
keep it simple. Super super simple.
Now,
um,
let's see
who would like to
share their resume.
Maybe if you have different versions of
your resume,
but who would like to share their resume
as it looks right now? and we can start
looking at it and dropping some feedback
in um in the chat.
Now, I know Timothy, you are you haven't
began editing your resume just yet. So,
Key and David, I think
>> could show mine. I don't mind.
>> Okay. Well, Key raised her hand.
>> Oh, she did first. Okay, that's fine.
She did. Oh, no. Wait, wait,
>> David. We're gonna You stepped up.
>> You stepped up. We're gonna have you
show your your resume. We're going to
have Key show hers,
>> but let's let's take a peek at your
resume first.
>> Okay. Hold on.
>> Yeah.
All right. Oh, nice and clean. Now,
can you make it bigger? I'm blind.
[laughter]
>> You want me to make it bigger? Hold on.
Hold on.
>> Yes, please.
[clears throat]
>> And my eyesight just gets worse every
year.
>> Is that good?
>> Uh, no.
>> Still too small. Hold on. [laughter]
It doesn't help that Zoom always makes
things like smaller if you've got a
bigger screen.
>> How's that?
>> That's better.
>> Okay. So, this is this is what mine
looks like now.
>> Okay.
All right. Now, what I can say right now
is I can see that you're really
retaining a lot that that we've been
talking about
because it's got all of the information
there. You've got your summary, your
technical skills.
If uh you you scroll down a little bit,
I see projects.
>> I got to change this one because I'm not
in this internship anymore.
Uh, but you did it. No.
>> Why would you?
>> I mean, if I keep all the projects, I'm
going to have Well, I guess I could keep
it and just add some more.
>> Okay, let's scroll down a little bit and
see. Is that Is that what you've got?
Okay. Okay. Those are your projects.
Okay, good.
>> And now you've got your exper excuse me,
your experience.
>> Wonderful.
>> Okay.
And then so I have a gap here. So I put
student because I wasn't working for
about a year and a half.
>> Okay. And you know what? That's okay.
There are ways to to note that.
>> Yeah.
>> Now
really
I think
David, I think this is an incredible
start.
>> Oh, thanks. Absolutely.
I think that it it looks fantastic, but
a lot the length of your resume can
actually be shortened if we worked on
the um the formatting.
>> Okay?
>> Right. So, go up to the top.
>> Okay.
>> Let's start let's start with your name.
Now,
I now and this is in your um this is
Google Sheets. Great.
>> Yeah.
>> Great.
Now,
what we need to do is condense the
information at the top.
>> Yeah, I see that.
>> You know,
>> yeah. And you
you don't have to
say LinkedIn and then the link.
>> Oh, got it.
>> The portfolio and then the link. GitHub
and the link.
>> You can just put LinkedIn.
>> Yeah.
>> And hyperlink
LinkedIn.
>> Well, oh, this. You mean this one? Yeah.
Okay.
>> You know what I mean? Same with your
portfolio.
>> Hyperlink it. Just say portfolio and
drop that in.
>> Same with GitHub.
>> Okay.
>> Right.
>> And now
>> WordPress developer, your headline here.
>> Yeah.
>> That goes directly underneath your name.
>> Okay.
>> Right.
>> Yeah.
>> The
>> What's up? What about the rest of it?
Get rid of it or just put or the whole
thing?
>> Nope. You have to, you know, you have to
condense it a little bit.
>> Okay.
>> So,
I wish I could do this in real time. Um,
>> could he push the the links off to the
right?
Um,
it should
it should be kind of like underneath
each other, not like on either. It's
distracting,
>> right?
>> So,
David, can you email me your resume?
>> Yeah.
>> All right. Here's my email address.
Now, I think you need to give me you
need to share it.
>> Oh, okay. How do I do that?
>> So, go up to share. It's the blue button
on the upper right.
>> Oh, yeah.
>> I can see it.
>> Okay. Now, you're going to put my email
address in there.
>> Okay. What was where was it? You put it
in the chat or no?
>> Yep, I put it in the chat. In the chat.
So, you can just copy and paste it.
>> I think I got to stop sharing to be able
to see the chat. Hold on.
>> Okay.
>> I believe I do anyway.
Let's see.
>> Or I can just give it to you. Or
>> No, no. Hold on. I'll see it. I I can
see it now. I couldn't see it before.
>> Yeah, no worries.
>> All right. Give me one second
>> because I'll be able to explain how to
edit. Okay.
>> A little bit better if I'm like doing it
in real time.
>> What is it? 28
Gmail.
>> And now you've got to copy the link,
>> okay?
and put it in the chat
because you have to give me basically
you've got to make me a v um a viewer.
>> Okay, there it is.
>> All right, let me see if I can get
access to it.
>> It says, well, I have my general access
says access anybody with the link. So
>> yeah,
>> you should you should go.
>> Sometimes you can't edit
which
>> Oh, I gotcha.
>> Yeah. All right, let's see.
H Okay.
Yeah, I'm [clears throat] requesting
access.
Wait, you know what? Hold on a second.
You know what I can do?
file.
Ah, that's what I can do. I can make a
copy. Boom.
Cool. All right. Give me a sec.
Now I'll really be able to do this in
real time.
Um
okay.
All right guys,
so I'm sharing my screen
which it will only share
This is it. This is it.
All right. Can everyone see?
>> Yes.
>> Excellent. All right. So,
>> can you make it a little bit bigger?
>> Oh, boy.
All right. How do I do that?
>> Right. How do I do that? do the little
three dots in the top right.
>> You usually I find the best way is just
hold the control key and scroll with the
mouse, but
>> Oh,
>> that usually works on most things.
>> I'm on a Mac, so
>> that might be difficult then.
>> So, wait,
>> no. The top right there's three little
dots.
>> Way up on the top almost. Ah,
>> here. Yeah.
And then you go down towards a zoom in
the middle of the page or the middle of
the box.
>> Boom.
>> Yep.
>> I had it on 200.
>> All right. There there there there's a
different way that I think everybody is
not noticing.
See the giant 100% there or underneath
format?
>> No. Yes. Now I do. There it is.
>> Oh yeah. Boy, I'll tell you.
All right, guys. But or I can do it this
way, I think. Oh, you know what? Can
everyone see this? Well,
>> yeah. Yeah.
>> All right,
>> that's good.
>> Okay. So, all right. I see what's going
on here. So,
I haven't done this in a minute.
All right. So, I need to condense this.
So I think it yes format
>> spacing
custom spacing
and then I'm going to just start at one
there.
>> Okay.
>> All right. So what I would do Okay. So I
said we want to take this
Okay,
there we go. Let me You know what? I
need to actually look at mine for a
second, too.
All right.
Who's that? Oh, Kai.
All right.
Keeping it super simple
right
>> now.
>> Now, okay. You want to list your
location? Cool.
Hi, Kai.
We are editing resumes.
Now,
I didn't do it, but you should because
it just looks nicer.
So,
I would
You've got Well, you want a hyperlink,
>> not hyperlink, but put the
insert link. Boom.
And now, here's what I do.
Now, you highlight
Insert link
LinkedIn.
And this is your portfolio. Fantastic.
insert the link.
[clears throat]
Can I here? There we go.
And then GitHub.
There we go.
Okay.
This feels
is this font feels like it's bolded, but
I can't see.
Maybe because Here.
Hold on. There.
Oops.
There you are. Now,
>> that's a lot better.
>> Yeah. You want to
Now, if you want to keep this,
you can.
I think I Yeah, I have a I have a spacer
on each one, I think.
>> Yeah.
And now you have your summary. Okay. But
again,
there's
some spacing that's kind of funky.
Format your line spacing. You always
want it on single.
>> Okay.
And you go down to custom and
let's start at three here.
Yeah. And
not
don't need to be doesn't need to be bold
unless it's this bit here.
>> Yeah.
So now we're already
working on the spacing. It's already
where it needs to be. Now here you can
also get a little I would
keep things consistent. Use three.
>> Yeah.
>> And now
All right. Now, with this,
you want, and I know it's a little like,
why does she care about the line
spacing? It it really it it matters.
>> Oh, no. I I agree.
>> You know, so what I love about Google
Sheets
is that
where did that go?
I don't want this here. Now, what you
can do,
because what I want to do is get the
this bullet these bullets lined up.
>> What you can do,
>> see, you go up at the top with that
arrow.
>> Yeah.
>> And you can move
everything over.
>> But wait, this is weird.
This is kind of
Hold on.
Oops. Yeah.
All right. Now,
okay. Now it's [clears throat] not as
funky.
Okay.
>> That looks better,
>> right? Yeah,
>> I mean you had I mean you did all the
work and like I said you it was a
beautifully crafted resume
and clearly you're listening and
absorbing and putting into practice what
we've been talking about because all I
did was move stuff around.
>> Yeah.
>> And then you know from here you keep
going over it. Okay. Do I really like
this WordPress develop? Okay. You know
what? Let me let me throw this into chat
GPT and see if I can what else I can
come up with.
>> Can you send how how can I get this back
so I can put it in my resume?
>> Well, what you do is I will forward it
back to you.
>> Okay.
>> I will share it with you.
>> Okay.
>> In order for you to
work off of this one.
>> Yeah. you do exactly what I did and make
a copy so that you can edit.
>> And then what I personally find easier
and much more easeful is if you are
tailoring your resume for each
application that you are submitting.
>> Yeah. And you want to keep So say you're
you're doing that but you want to keep
this as like your template.
>> Yeah.
>> Then
every time you're adjusting and
tailoring, what you do is you go into
this template and you say file, make a
copy.
>> Okay?
>> And then you work off of the copy so
that you always have this original.
>> Oh, that makes sense. always have this
to refer to.
>> I was always wondering how I was going
to change my resume each time I put in a
new application. That makes a lot of
sense. Okay, cool.
>> And Google tricks.
>> Yeah. And Google Sheets is all is the
easiest way to do that. Now, when you
want to send that, when you're happy
with your resume and you're ready to uh
apply to the job
file,
download,
>> yeah,
>> PDF. Never ever apply with Word document
resume.
>> Okay.
>> Because it can be altered.
>> Okay.
Yeah, I mean designers can alter a PDF
as well, but let's just try to make it
as difficult as possible. Also,
sometimes
shady staffing firms like to get a hold
of people's resumes, remove their name,
put and and their contact information,
put the staffing agency name, and submit
them for jobs without asking them. and
then calling the candidate and saying,
"Hey, I found your resume online. Think
you'd be great for this role. We
actually submitted you and the candidate
and the client wants to meet you."
>> Wow.
>> It happens. I've worked for companies
that did that.
>> Wow. So
yeah, but you know you can
again
mess with the projects. Take this little
take this little tack out.
>> You know,
see the contrast. It's,
>> you know, it's professional.
>> Yeah.
>> It's easy on the eyes. It's easy to
read. It's not like, whoa, everything's
bolded and what's going on here? I mean,
and I like the fact that I guess is this
a Yeah, great. It's a hyperlink and
that's great. And you're showing me and
I love that. But keep it simple. But
this is great.
>> This is what you did. This is great.
>> Well, I didn't just do this this week.
I've had this pretty much made.
[laughter]
>> It's okay. Don't tell anybody that.
Don't minimize Don't minimize the You
know what I'm saying? Don't minimize the
work that you've done, David.
>> No, I'm not. I'm I'm not.
>> This This This is some really really
good work.
>> Oh, thank you.
>> You should be real like, you know,
giving yourself a nice little pat on the
back for this one.
>> All right, let me do that now.
>> Yeah, there you go.
But, you know, [clears throat] you can
see where we're already reducing,
you know, we're reducing the length of
this.
>> Yeah. I like the with the way you're
formatting it.
>> Yeah. Well, if you will allow me to
finish it and if I can get it to you in
a day or so.
>> Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
>> Let me let me finish it because
Yeah. Now, now I'm in it.
>> Okay.
Now, now I'm in it. All right. So, we're
going to stop sharing.
>> Okay,
>> everyone. Was that helpful or was that
like incredibly boring? I feel like it
was it was helpful for for David, but I
think it kind of does it give you all an
idea of of what we're talking about
here.
>> Yeah, I found it helpful. I did have a
question though um regarding the
formatting
>> um specifically for like the skills
section.
>> Is it better to have like those like
bulletointed skills or like I think mine
are in like groups under like the type
of skill or like the technology that
they're used.
>> Either or. It's really your preference.
Yeah, I think I did that. I think I put
them in the columns and I think it was
just because of
>> the amount that you had and I felt that
they were all very valuable and spoke to
who you are or who you were in that
moment that I saw your resume and I
wanted to make sure that I was able to
express all of that in an organized way.
And at that time I thought that those
columns were the right thing to do.
But you could shift that around.
>> Yeah. Whatever whatever speaks to you
because again your resume is much like
your portfolio, much like your GitHub,
it is evolving and will evolve until the
day that you have your retirement party.
Right.
>> It's it is a living breathing
story of
what you've done in your professional
career and it is constantly evolving
especially for those of you who are in
tech. Tech is constantly evolving.
So it is definitely going to shift.
There are going to be some skills and
programs and
there's going to be plenty of of
frameworks and databases and tools that
probably in a year or two no one's going
to be using. Right.
>> Yeah.
Change changes constantly. That's for
sure. It does. So your format sets the
stage for everything else.
>> So
think about the next several hours or
this week if you're not able to attend
tomorrow. you know, pick one structure,
the reverse chronological
or the functional, and rebuild your base
layout using the guide that we used this
evening.
Now, tomorrow,
oh, and here's your homework.
>> Create a one-page draft layout or even
two pages if that's what it's going to
be. I hate when people are like, "It has
to be one page." It's not true. It's
not.
Add your header, your summary, and your
skills section
just like we did with David this
evening. And you know what you can also
do
is
you can also
lay out the framework. And maybe you
don't have a summary yet. Maybe you want
to think about it. Maybe you want to
play around a little bit with chat GPT
or claude or whichever AI platform
you're using. You could just write
gibberish.
So it's just a placeholder
or part of a paragraph of your favorite
poem or story just to kind of use as a
placeholder. My husband teaches me all
of this stuff. He's he's a designer for
a software development company. He's an
incredible incredible designer and he
does this sort of like layout and he is
the the the his remitt is he
>> um basically works with all of the
seauite leaders and designs all of their
um you know all of their speaking
engagements, their presentations, their
all of all of that stuff. So he's the
one that taught me how to do all this
stuff. Cool.
>> Um, so I'm paying it forward. Um, but
you know, just work on the header, the
summary, the skill section. Right.
Right. Gibberish. But like
>> we're we're talking about format here.
We're not necessarily talking about the
content. Right. And then bring it to
tomorrow's Q&A for, you know, peer and
coach review if you're able to. Now, a
clear focused format
shows recruiters you respect their time,
right?
>> Yeah.
>> And it's the first sign you're ready to
be hired. If your resume is like slab
kebab all over the place,
what is your output going to be?
>> Not going to get a job.
It's going to be tough. You might you
might be able to slide in there. And
now, um, Kai, uh, just to give you a
quick review, we were talking in the
beginning of the this Q&A session about
the reverse chronological resume versus
the functional resume and what the
difference is and when to use it. And
it's really the crux of it is, you know,
both are great. The reverse
chronological is most common and
preferred for consistent career paths.
So someone like you, if you were going
to continue to uh focus on a job in
within the architecture field,
using that is,
you know, something that you could do.
It highlights a steady progression and
recent experience and it is easy for
recruiters and ATS systems to read. But
for career changers, I actually called
it a career shape shifter today and I
had to laugh at myself. But
it's a functional skills-based resume is
ideal for career changers or those with
mixed experience. So, it's perfect for I
don't know if you all remember a couple
of weeks ago, Michelle was talking about
how she craft should should she have two
different LinkedIn profiles? Would
should she do that for her resume
because she's also like a big production
and lighting designer? Well, you know,
this functional resume is actually
really good for people who have mixed
experience. And you know that functional
resume can actually speak to both of her
talents which personally I think kind of
speak to each other and kind of give a
nice highlight. You know her if I were a
recruiter hiring for a developer and I
got to talking to Michelle and she was
talking about her lighting design
career. I' I'd be like so excited. Um,
and and it gives me an I like it gives
me an insight of who she is, who she
was, who what her path is, what she's
looking to be. So, that actually adds a
nice bit of
seasoning, right? It's that blue cheese
on the iceberg wedge.
Why am I saying this? But I'm hungry.
Um,
but ne tomorrow we are going to
we're going to keep building our resume
live, right? We're going to build
onepage resumeé layout with a proper
structure, clear sections, recruiter
ready formatting
just like we did tonight. So, we're
going to get a little bit deeper and
hopefully if all of you want to come,
please come. If any of you talk to any
of the other students tomorrow and
they're looking for like live revisions,
let's go.
Yeah. [clears throat] All right.
>> Well, Kai and I have a meeting tomorrow
morning. We could probably see if we can
get some of our group into [laughter]
your group tomorrow.
come. I mean, this is like some of the
most important stuff, the resume, and
it's nice to be able to do it in a
group. So, because then you get ideas.
>> Yeah.
>> And you feed off of each other.
>> Sorry, Key. I called you Kai by
accident. [laughter]
>> I know. I get confused by both of them,
too, sometimes when I see them.
>> Especially when we're in the same
meeting. [laughter]
>> I know. I know. I know. I always see us
on either side of the group.
[laughter] I see your keys over there
and it's just always like the
>> I don't know why, but it's so true,
isn't it? [laughter]
>> So, have a wonderful, wonderful evening.
David,
continue working on the content
>> of your resume. What I'm going to do is
keep everything as is, but I'm going to
I'm going to edit it
>> and then you can go wild.
>> All right. Cool. Thank you.
>> All right. Great seeing all of you and
have a beautiful evening.
>> Thank you.
>> Bye.
>> Thank you.
>> Thanks.
