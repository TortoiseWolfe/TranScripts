Hey there, Dave. We'll just we'll we'll
wait a couple minutes for more people to
join.
>> Sounds good.
Hey, Leo. We're just waiting a few
minutes for others to join.
>> All right.
Okay. I'm sure we will have others uh
joining
but
um just want to start
reviewing a little bit
um
especially for Leo because I want to
make sure
we're reviewing everything that we went
over last night.
All right, hang on. So, I think that was
last night.
All right.
All right.
Now,
Leo, you've been um applying to roles
pretty consistent pretty consistently.
Yeah.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah.
Do you have a job description
of a position that you've recently
applied to?
>> I can definitely look for one on the
history of LinkedIn.
Cool.
Because what I'd like to do is show how
to
tailor
a resume summary
to a job description. And we'll we'll
we'll do that live.
So, we'll do that.
We've got Dave's resume, too.
All right.
All right. So,
Why is this not
Sorry, I'm trying to find my place here.
My little cheat sheet.
So,
tonight, while Leo, if you don't mind,
I'll just get started while you're
looking. Right.
>> Um, but
you know, we're tonight will be somewhat
of a professional
resume summary clinic
and job description alignment. And and
Leo, you probably recall, we've been
editing uh David's uh resume in real
time. And last night uh we started uh
focusing um on our resume summaries
and we came up with uh a couple of
options
uh for an imaginary um person or people
folks that were QAs maybe more data
analytics data analytics focused as well
as full stack development. Um, we're
lucky that we're we have uh Dave's
resume that we're doing in real time.
So, we we came up with a couple options
through chat GPT and I did that live uh
with David's already beautifully crafted
a summary. Um, but then we came up with
like four to five options and Dave was
able to pick which option he preferred
and and we had a discussion around that
as well.
So, tonight we're going to go a little
bit further, right? Um, we are looking
um
what I'd like to do is,
you know, we learned yesterday we
learned the structure. Today, what I'd
like to do is refine
uh summaries and see how to tailor
summaries to real jobs in the current
market. And so the idea that I think is
is interesting and will be interesting
even more so for Dave and and Dave if if
there's a job description that or a
position that you've been looking at
that you want to apply to and you have
that job description then what we can do
is take the summary that we chose and
crafted yesterday.
>> Okay,
>> and we can see how to tailor it to real
jobs. And so a real job description,
right?
>> Yeah.
>> So,
you know, now just looking at this
summary and considering your resume
summary, Dave and Leo,
who feels that your summary is a six out
of 10 or higher right now?
I'd say mine's at least I'd say mine's
over six out of 10, I believe.
>> Absolutely.
>> Absolutely.
>> Um,
wherever you are on the scale,
the goal is to leave tonight's
resume clinic
um, a fewer levels higher.
>> Okay. All
>> right.
Now,
how are you doing, Leo? Finding
anything?
>> I think I found one. It's a decently big
description with a lot of things to go
through instead of the small blurb that
some companies put on. And also, it's an
actual company, not a recruitment thing.
>> Nice. Nice. Now, um would you do me a
favor and just pop the link?
>> Yeah.
>> In the Yeah, let's do it that way. I
think that'll be a good way to do it.
>> There we go.
>> All right.
All right.
Let's see what this bad boy is.
And and Dave, why don't you pull that up
as well, just so that you have it.
>> The link
>> the what? Say it again.
>> The the link
uh that Leo just dropped.
>> Oh, I didn't. Okay.
>> Yeah. So, this, you know, this will just
do for funsies because we have it. Um,
this is a front-end web developer
um position that that I Leo, you applied
to this recently.
>> Yes.
>> Okay, cool.
>> Yes.
>> And
so we can do this in real time. Leo, if
you want us to use your summary, we can
use your summary as well.
>> Okay. Like just paste in the chat as
well or
>> Yeah, go ahead and chase that. Paste
that in the chat.
There you go.
Okay.
All right. Let me let me find zoom
again. There it is.
All right. So, we've got that.
And now

And
I got to broaden this a little bit in
order for me to share my screen. Second.

screen.

All right. Can you guys see my screen?
>> Um, I'm looking I'm looking for a jobs.
That was what I was doing.
>> And this is just going to be a chat GBT.
>> Okay.
>> Okay.
So,
there we go.
All right. Now, what we're going to do
is we go into chat GPT. We want to
tailor this summary
to the job description. Hopefully, this
will work now. Um, okay. So as I
mentioned yesterday when you are in chat
GPT claude any of these AI platforms I
have found and I've been told that the
more information and context that you
supply the better the outcome. So I'm
going to get a little granular with
this. Uh I am a frontend developer

That's not what you're writing.

So,

that's what I was just reading.
Option one, balanced and professional.
Now, Leo, David and Timothy
were here yesterday
and
we talked about
a structure
that should be used
for
developing and crafting
your
um
uh your resume summary.
Now, I don't know if you can scroll up
as I did to the beginning of, you know,
sort of the chat,
but I'll put it in again and paste it in
again. This is the structure that we
talked about the summary should have,
which will explain uh a little bit more.
It's trying to get in. I can't see.
Give me a second. Oh, I'm someone's
trying to come in and I can't
I cannot
allow Ah, here we go. Here's Anna.
Couldn't allow anyone in.
Hey, Anna.
All right. So,
>> hello.
>> If you can see the Oh, no worries. So
Leah, what we we talked about initially
in yesterday's session was the structure
to use every time for your resume
summary. So it's really about in line
one, who you are and your main focus.
Line two, what you do well, including
tools and skills.
Line three, proof of impact or
contribution.
line four or five what you want next and
how you want to add value. So that as
you can see like in option one that we
pulled and just crafted
it explains all of this very clearly. So
this is option one. Let's look at option
two. This is resultsdriven and technical
front-end developer with expertise in
modern JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React
frameworks. Line one, who you are and
your main focus.
There you go. Right.
Uh, where am I? Sorry, this has been a

visually engaging web interfaces that
focus flawlessly that perform flawlessly
across devices. Line two, what you do
well, including tools or skills. There
it is.
Okay.

documentation, and efficient version
control using Git. Line three, proof of
impact and contribution.

trained in AstroJS and eager to
contribute technical precision and
creative problem solving to KCL's
growing engineering team.
KCL is the name of the company,
everyone. That's the acronym, Crazy
Coupon Lady.
Okay, so
there it is. Line four or five. What do
you want next? And how do you want to
add value?
Now, we've got option three,
human- centered and brand aligned.
front-end web developer who combines
strong technical foundations in
JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, and
AstroJS with a genuine focus on user
experience. Skilled in debugging,
performance optimization, and
collaborating across teams to deliver

best one for me.
>> Okay, cool.
Cool. Do you want me to to paste it in
the chat so you have it?
>> Yeah, sure.
>> Okay.
But now you can see what I've done and
how I came to that.

>> Yeah, I like that one a lot. I think it
speaks to my I'm I'm saying I'm a new
developer. I don't have any experience
in this yet really. And that I actually
I actually went and looked into the the
um firm and how like you know I did some
history that shows that of interest.
>> Absolutely.
>> So I like the third one.
>> Yeah. And I like the third one too
because as you as you said it is an it
is entry level and growth focused
>> without saying that you're entry level.
>> Yeah. Exactly.
>> All right. So that one's pretty good.
But don't
>> All right.
>> Isn't is it possible like I saw some
people some recruiters saying they're
never they're never going to look at a
resume created with AI. How would they
know it's done with AI?
>> They said they could tell.
Yeah, they can tell. I can tell when a
resume is done with AI. But that's why
you have to be creative and know the
signals of AI.
>> Now,
one is the
am sign, right? The the this that is
this
long dash here.
>> Okay. you have to remove that and put
commas if it shows up in anywhere in the
the resume.
>> I get what you're saying. Yeah.
>> Yeah. And
now I've also read something uh recently
that when you copy and paste
um things from
uh an an AI platform
>> Yeah. into like say a word document
>> that it leaves watermarks.
>> Oh, really?
>> Oh, I didn't know that.
>> So, that's something to to look into.
>> Okay.
But
honestly,
if I were working at this company and I
saw this resume summary, I wouldn't
think that it
was
>> an AI summary or AI resume.
So,
>> especially if it's hitting on all the
points that are true, all of your truth
in terms of your skill set
>> and experience. Mhm.
And I mean, you know, I think that
I think that there are
some recruiters
who
get a little bit high on their horse
>> about AI,
like as if they're the AI experts.
>> Yeah.
>> Come on, guys. Give me a break.
And and who was this recruit? I I would
love to know who this recruiter was that
made this statement, right? Is it like a
Amazon recruiter, Google?
>> Oh, I don't I don't remember.
>> Apple recruiter, like come on.
>> I don't know if it was or not. Yeah,
>> whatever.
You know what? Then if if she's never
going to look at an AI generated resume,
then I guess she's not looking at any
resumes at all
>> these days.
>> Oh, this
>> I was thinking that. Why would you do
everything from scratch when you got um
our 2D2 who can just spit it out in the
split second?
>> And and listen, you know what? It it's
not like you're doing everything from
scratch,
you know, and and it's not as if you're
using AI for every single thing, but the
technology is there to use.
And you know, you have people saying,
"Oh, the technology is theirs to use,
and if you're not using it, then you're
a failure." But you're a failure if you
use it. Shut up. No,
>> shut up and sit down.
>> More like overuse. Aka the CEO is trying
to replace everybody,
>> right? You know, it's kind of like
listen, I the technology is here to use,
you're using it,
>> you're crafting a meaningful resume. And
by the way, that takes time even if
you're using AI.
>> Yeah.
>> And you know what? Use phrases like, and
I do this all the time,
do not
make
what your answer is, whatever you are
generating,
make it sound human.
Make it sound like it is not generated.
>> Yeah.
>> From AI.
It'll tell It'll do what you tell it to
do.
So tell GBT to not make it sound like
you gen it generated it.
>> Yeah,
>> that's
>> I do that all the time. I do that all
the time.
>> Yeah.
>> I never thought of that.
>> Yeah.
>> And if that doesn't work, take what it's
spit out and change it yourself.
>> Exactly. Exactly. Give it your own,
you know, voice and your own flare. I I
just I I think you know I think I think
people get a little too high and mighty
>> in their positions. I really do. And
it's just like just sit back and calm
down, right? And and and and
look at a resume and if you're unsure,
reach out to that candidate and speak to
them.
>> Yeah, that's true.
>> That's what your job is. It's to speak
to people, not just look at resumeumés
and judge them and
you know and and archive the resume.
>> Yeah,
>> please don't even get me started. Um,
so
we
connected
two different summaries
to real job posts.
I'm in I was into it. Timothy, you're
not saying anything. You're usually
saying stuff. I'm worried about you
here.
>> Where are you? We need your opinion. I I
I I was going to throw in a comment that
uh yeah um that uh with all the high and
mightiness around me, there shall be no
lack of helium in the universe at all.
>> Yes. Yeah. Okay. So, I wanted to make
sure that you were you hear and it
wasn't just is this a mouse or a cat? Is
that what are you?
>> Oh, you're a wolf. Okay. Sorry,
>> it looks
>> I'm just I'm just dealing with a um the
the computer decided to do one of its
Windows updates
>> and in the process it did not uh save
all of my tabs that I had opened.
>> So, I'm trying to go through the history
to pull back the tabs.
>> I hate that.
>> So, that I have the stuff because that's
like I hadn't finished looking at all of
it.
Okay.
>> So, that's that's why I'm quiet. I'm
just trying to listen and just
>> All good. All good.
>> But, you know, the point here, right, is
that we're just tailoring an already
great resume or a great summary that
that David has been craft crafting and
allowing us to observe the evolution of
it.
you know, we we we just tailored it.
So,
it
you know, you can take a generic
summary and adapt it to a posting. Okay.
So
a generic
um
full a generic uh summary for a full
stack developer could read something
like full stack developer with
experience in JavaScript and React
builds full stack applications and
enjoys learning new technologies
seeking
software development roles.
Right? So something a little bit more
tailored
could look like
full stack developer with experience in
JavaScript, React, NodeJS, and REST
APIs.
builds and tests features that integrate
with third-party services and back-end
systems.
Completed projects that include
authentification,
API integration,
and responsive UI
targeting roles where I can contribute
to feature development and automation
testing within an agile team.
You just make that up. That was pretty
good.
>> It's, you know, it and it's especially
if
like to me this tailored summary
in the job description, it must be for
an agile environment.
Um,
so
now we check for consistency
across your assets,
right? When we start
crafting. So when we landed on a summary
like we did last night with David's
summary.
Okay,
your summary should
match your LinkedIn headline and about
tone
shouldn't be identical. Your resume
summary should not be identical to your
LinkedIn about section, but it should
mirror each other in tone.
your job title and your skills
in the experience
and skills section. Those should match
and match the kind of roles you actually
apply apply for.
So look at the roles that you're
applying for.
Look at the consistency across them and
start maybe
curating your headline
to have some of the skills that are
required in some of those job
descriptions that you're targeting.
I have a question.
>> Yes. Um a lot of these summaries and
stuff that you're suggest suggesting and
that have read um any of those
will be viable for a student in tech joy
who let's say they're in the explore
they're at the explore stage I mean not
explore but the um intern stage
>> but they're doing a career transfer or
they they're totally new into this
Anyway,
um that's why I'm wondering about some
of the verbiage when they say
experienced and experienced. Yeah, it
may be academic, but the employer might
be wanting
interpreted as you worked on pre you
worked in previous jobs doing this and
that's where your experience is coming
from.
>> But if they look at your resume, they
shouldn't perceive that.
>> Okay.
>> Yeah.
>> You know what I mean? And also
that's why Dr. Emily curated this
program in the way that she did because
you know and it was brilliant in the way
that she thought about this and thought
this through because the the whole
>> idea
to
provide an internship
for her students to work on real
projects with real clients and real
outcomes.
is so that
you're not forced to step into an
internship at another company that
you're actually ready to hit the ground
running
in a real role.
>> Okay?
>> You know what I mean?
>> Yeah.
So
getting back to the alignment with
LinkedIn in your resume. If your resume
summary targets full stack roles,
but your LinkedIn headline says open to
any anything
>> or professional
>> or
um
>> developer
>> developer
that confuses recruiters.
If your summary lists Python and SQL,
but your skills
section does not,
that looks careless.
So,
some action steps,
copy your final summary into your
LinkedIn about section
and then adapt it there.
Right. So, David,
you've got a resume summary that you're
excited about.
Take what maybe you've curated already
in LinkedIn for your LinkedIn summary
and play around with it in chat GPT.
see how you can take that resume
summary, keep that as your main and then
tell chat GPT or claude or whichever AI
platform you're using, you know, this is
my resume summary.
the a tailor
create a new
summary for my about section
for my LinkedIn profile.
This new LinkedIn about summary should
mirror
my resume summary in tone only.
It should not be identical.
See what it says. See what it spits out.
More action steps. Check your target
role.
Check that your target role is the same
across your resume and profile. Now, not
what you are tailoring specifically and
applying to, but if you want full stack
developer roles,
the tone and the cadence need to be the
same across your resume in your LinkedIn
profile.
Check that your top three skills appear
in your summary
skills section,
LinkedIn about, and your LinkedIn
skills.
It should all be smooth across the
board,
right? So, this positions you as someone
who understands
brand consistency
and recruiter workflow because who are
you ultimately at the end of the day?
Sure, you're Leo, David, Timothy, Anna.
Yes, you are all students of TechJoy.
You're all looking to shift careers,
but you're a brand first and foremost
in this world, right? We live in a world
of marketing.
It's all we are.
We're brands.
We're no longer human.
And the people who have been succeeding
in this culture
are a lot of the
millennials,
Gen Y,
because what do they have over boomers
and Gen Z? understand the concept of
marketing
because they've been marketed to on all
kinds of platforms since the day they
were born. They've held a computer in
their hand
since they were kids at a restaurant
with their parents because their parents
want to have a couple glasses of wine
and talk to their friends and family and
keep their kids quiet.
These kids, these generations
have created
films.
They've created content.
They've created photo collages.
>> Yeah. Entrepreneurs making big money.
>> Yes.
That's right. And that's another thing.
They've been influencers
since the day they were born. That's the
culture.
So
just when you look in the mirror
tonight,
you're a brand.
You might be Anna, but you're a brand.
And that's how you need to look at this
job search.
That's what how you need to look at your
LinkedIn profile. It is your storefront.
That is how you market yourself. The
resume
is proof.
That's why they need to be a little
different. So
before we close, let's do a quick self
assessment with this checklist.
Okay.
Does my summary state a clear target
role?
Does it list key tools or skills that
match real job posts?
Does it include at least one piece of
proof?
What does it say? Does it say that I
want what I want to do next?
Can someone skim it in five seconds and
understand my direction?
You know, if if you answered yes to most
of these, you're in strong shape.
your homework this week.
Finalize your professional summary.
>> Yes,
dear Timothy,
>> question before before I dive too deep
into this.
>> Yeah. Um,
after the meeting yesterday, um, since I
had it up already,
>> I was poking around in LinkedIn
>> and I came across there's a hidden field
that I guess is not normally shown up
under your profile for projects.
I don't know if that was looked at or
discussed in any of the previous things
or not, but
>> it was new to me.
>> Okay.
>> So, I'm just kind of wondering if
I should pursue filling this in with
things that I have done over the years
because it lets me link to stuff that
I've already done and talk about it in a
bit more detail.
I'm going to pull up my profile.
I don't think I've seen that. Maybe I
>> Yeah, like I said, it's hidden.
>> Where is it hidden?
>> Um,
let me see.
>> I think I might have seen that.
>> Um,
how Oh, add a profile section.
And under recommended there is an add
project.
>> You mean recommendations?
>> So is it all the way at the bottom?
>> No, it's it's well it's it's under
recommended
at least on mine anyways. That's where
it's showing up.
recommended or recommendations.
>> Recommended.
>> I don't know where recommend. I don't
see anything that says recommended on my
LinkedIn profile.
Let me uh
uh
this is the screen I want.
So here under the add profile section.
>> Okay. Uh I don't
>> there's core recommended and additional
and mine is under recommended add
projects.
>> Uhhuh.
All right. Let me look at mine cuz
>> And that comes up with stuff like this
that lets me add in projects that I've
worked on.
>> Okay, I see where it is.
I mean, I guess
I've never obviously I've personally
have never looked at this before,
but I suppose you could if you wanted
to. Sure.
>> Oh, good play. I mean, for for somebody
like me, and I think Anna might be able
to use this too, depending upon what she
has and her past.
um a lot of like I've done stuff over
the years here there whatever
which is coding
it's just it's not web design coding but
it's coding
>> sure
interesting thank you for sharing that
yeah I mean it can't hurt I personally
don't think it could hurt why Yeah.
>> Well, that's what I was kind of thinking
is like, you know, I mean, somebody
going from 30 years of chemistry into
programming, they're going to say,
"Well,
>> skip that one."
>> But if I got a thing up showing that
over those 30 years, I built the
VBScript program. I've written little
scripts in our limbs programs. I've done
this, this, this, this. I have a
>> a playable game out under ReactJam.
Well,
Yeah,
>> you can't deny any of that. The proof is
right there.
>> Sure. Yeah. I'd be very interested to
see how it shows up on LinkedIn when you
filled that out. I don't know if I've
ever seen anything
anything like that in the past.
>> Well, I don't know if people poke
around, but me, I like poking around. If
I'm going to be doing something, I'm
going to poke around to see what's
there.
>> Yeah. No, like lift up the hood for
sure.
>> 100%.
Okay. I like it.
>> I like it a lot.
>> I feel kind of guilty when it comes to
LinkedIn because
Yeah. It's out in the desert on my end.
I haven't done anything with it.
>> Yeah. But you know what? It's your
storefront
and that is how recruiters uh find
candidates.
>> Yeah.
>> So if you're not using it
>> if you're not using it Yeah. you're
you're doing yourself a disservice for
sure.
>> Well, a lot of us still think of it as
just a place to
connect
to people that we know at work and that
was about it cuz that's all that it
originally was. Now, now it's your
>> this other stuff,
>> your basic online life, resume, history,
whatever.
>> Yeah. Well, you know, when I started
recruiting
um
uh my first recruiting job was in 2020
or it was in 2006.
That's when I started and that is when
they launched LinkedIn
and as a recruiter from the very
beginning
that I was told to utilize LinkedIn to
identify talent.
>> So from a recruiter's perspective, it's
always been a recruitment tool.
So think about that.
I think that people who are not
in a talent acquisition
or recruiter position
don't really understand or realize
that LinkedIn is our database. It is our
Bible. It is what we use
and different
types of recruiting
might also use Indeed.
>> You guys have to jump because there's
another meeting I have to get in. I'm
sorry.
>> Okay, no problem. Bye-bye.
>> Byebye.
I'm in a a different type of recruiting
now
and they they actually they use LinkedIn
they use LinkedIn a bit but they use
Indeed a bit more. I don't I haven't
used Indeed a ton. So it's a learning
curve for me but Indeed is also an
option as well.
So everyone thank you so much for your
time.
have a wonderful evening and hopefully
I'll see all of you uh next weekend. And
David, I'm gonna finish the formatting
of your resume by end of day Friday, God
willing.
>> Very good. Thanks so much, Chelsea.
>> You're welcome. Have a good day.
>> Bye, everyone.
