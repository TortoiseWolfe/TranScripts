I'll do That
Hey Kai, just waiting for a few other
people to join.
>> Hey
K, how's it going?
Hey David, we're just waiting for a few
others to join.
>> Okay, sounds good.
Okay,
we've got a crowd
tonight. Welcome uh back everyone.
Tonight we are focusing on something
that immediately increases your
visibility to recruiters. EU, which is
using the right keywords. Now, for those
of you who have not been in our resume
clinic sessions for the past few weeks,
we have been uh focused on
resumeé building and doing exactly what
we did with our LinkedIn clinic.
Uh we are starting from the tippy top
and that's where we started from the
name all of your information
uh contact information LinkedIn link
GitHub link if you have a portfolio
listing your portfolio and more
importantly your headline right and then
last week we moved on to creating your
summary.
and really developing that using a
structured formula. If you are curious
about all of that, definitely take a
look at the recordings.
So again, this evening we are talking
about using the right keywords in your
resume.
Um, this is really the bridge between
your resume, your LinkedIn skills, and
the job alerts you've been setting up on
LinkedIn or even Indeed, whichever
platform you're you're using. So, if
last week was about telling your story
clearly,
this week is about speaking the langu
language that employers are using. So
before we dive in,
type one word in the chat that describes
how confident you feel about tailoring
your resume to a job description.
Mhm.
Okay. Unsure. Okay. All right. Cool.
Well, you know, definitely for those of
you who haven't been here for the the
resume clinic, definitely uh try to
check out those um recordings because
they are pretty it's it's like a whole
story, right?
So,
thank you all for doing that. Um, so
we've got warming up, maybe nervous, eh,
unsure.
Cool. So, why keywords matter?
So, recruiters search
for candidates the same way you search
for things online.
Keywords.
Keywords determine how you show up in
those searches, right? So, your resume
needs three kinds of keywords,
technical skills, right?
So languages tools
frameworks
ro specific terms
front end
test automation
ETL
rest APIs
soft skills
tied to delivery
collaboration
communication
agile
Sprint planning,
hiring teams.
Use these terms in job descriptions,
recruiter searches, and interview
criteria.
ATS systems
scan for these keywords.
recruiters skim
for
clearly and effortlessly.
So,
>> sorry guys. Can you all hear me?
>> No, we can't.
>> Now you can. Okay. Sorry. I had uh if
any of you follow astrology, Mercury is
in retrograde
>> and two Mercury true Mercury retrograde
form. My laptop died. So I borrowed a
laptop because I had to put my laptop
with Apple. So I'm just having a lot of
malfunctions. So
um
so
reinforce
you know the the the
idea is
also to important to reinforce the link
to LinkedIn. So, as you put your
keywords in LinkedIn, your resume
keywords
should pretty much match your LinkedIn
skills. That alignment
increases
search visibility
and helps your profile appear in a
relevant
alerts,
relevant job alerts. So,
how do you extract?
All right. How do you extract keywords?
So,
let's walk through a real job
description together and and I'll show
you how to pull keywords the way that
recruiters do. So,
let me
screen.
Bear with me.
[snorts]
Description.
Give me one second. Just trying to find
my screen. Pull the job description.
Got it.
All right. So,
can everyone see my screen?
>> Yes.
>> Okay. So, I pulled a lead full stack
engineer job description.
It is at uh an advertising agency, an
agency that I've worked at, Publicist
Media. Now,
as you can see, we start off at the at
the very top.
Now,
job title,
lead full stack engineer.
responsibilities,
right?
Required skills or qualifications,
preferred
skills.
So, we have to kind of look in here and
see if there's any
nice to have kind of thing. doesn't seem
like it.
Tools mentioned in the stack. We see all
of the tools here in the stack that
they're looking for.
Okay. So,
in the chat,
list three key words that you feel
absolutely must appear on a resume for
this role.
See what we got here.
Okay,
good.
Good.
Excellent.
All right. So,
yes, full stack, JavaScript, databases,
REST APIs, MVC,
my MySQL.
Yep.
Yep. Got it.
So,
okay. So
any keyword that appears
multiple times,
that's a priority.
Any keyword that appears in both
required
and preferred
is a must add.
So
let's look at the job description here.
The only thing I really see as preferred
looks like is this bachelor degree in
computer science or related field
that's happening a lot in tech that I've
been seeing.
So
now it's your turn.
All of you take a moment,
find a job description
that matches your target role.
And when you find that job description
in the chat,
highlight
the top three technical keywords,
top two like ro action keywords,
top two environment keywords,
and any repeated tool or framework. And
I'll put that all in the chat for you.
and I'll give all of you a few minutes.
found an odd one that doesn't really
have like the description so short. I
don't even see a lot of keywords in it
other than WordPress, which has kind of
surprised me.
>> Then you may want to look at another job
description
or just work with the job description
that you have.
>> Yeah. I mean, I thought in theory we all
be able to do it with anyone, but I
mean, it's just we just want somebody
part-time for WordPress and everything
else is like part-time ASP.
Nothing I'd really count of as a keyword
or like a necessarily.
So, I thought it was I mean, it was kind
of random, but it was also kind of
interesting as a case study
for separate websites.
>> Payage
Jot everything you think in the chat.
>> Well, says we'll work closely with our
team, but not necessarily a key word. I
mean, you could say team. Well, it says
team. Put that as the keyword is team.
Chelsea,
can you can you give an example of an
environment keyword again?
>> I'm sorry.
>> Can you give an example of an
environment keyword?
>> Um, it would be like,
let me look at this job description that
I pulled up previously.
Um
I would say front end backend aspects
you could say as an environment both are
environment keywords so what you're kind
of working with
um it could also be
um
the type of team that you're going to be
on.
>> You might have that.
>> Okay.
Is anybody talking?
>> Not. No, we're we're
doing a
>> exercise.
>> Yeah.
>> Okay. Sorry.
>> No problem.
All right.
Oh, it's not in the chat.
>> No, we'll we'll get you on the next on
the next one.
Okay.
So in more specifically
uh Kai
an environment
keyword is kind of kind of what I
thought but it describes the setting
pace or structure of the workplace you
operate in. So it tells
you know the type of environment where
you will perform well. Fast-paced,
collaborative, agile, customer focused,
deadline driven, hybrid, on-site,
remote, high volume, startup,
enterprise, crossf functional,
mentorship or oriented, data driven,
productled.
So, these types of words help you match
your resume language
to the environment that the employer
highlights in the job description.
>> Okay.
>> Yeah. Okay.
>> Um, so for looking at keywords
specifically when something like how
specific do things need to get? Like if
the post is saying collaborating versus
collaborative, does that make a
difference?
>> No, it's the same word.
>> Okay.
>> Yeah. Just, you know,
>> in different ways. But um Michelle, what
we're talking about, we've been doing
for the past couple of weeks is our
resume clinic. We wrapped up with
LinkedIn and we've been focusing on the
resume and we've been doing exactly what
we were doing with LinkedIn with the
resume. So starting at the very top and
really breaking it down. So name,
contact information, headline. Last week
we did the summary. Today we're focusing
on identifying and using keywords.
So that's I you know we I
showed a job description. We looked at
some keywords there. Now we're doing a
live breakdown and extracting
uh keywords from
job description that I had everyone look
at and look for.
on their own.
>> Okay.
>> So, great. I mean, everyone looks like
they understand
the assignment. So, everything looks
good from what I'm seeing.
>> Um,
now
>> [clears throat]
>> So
[clears throat] look at some of the
comments in the chat.
uh see if any keywords are showing up
multiple times in some of these
>> uh
keywords that people threw out. I see
some similarities across the board.
So these if you were looking at three
different job descriptions
and you're looking at
like say you have three different jobs
that you want to apply to and you have
three different job descriptions in
front of you.
If you see keywords
that are showing up in all three job
descriptions,
these are your anchor keywords. They
belong in your skills section, your
summary and your experience bullets
where relevant.
Now,
it's really all about integrating
keywords
naturally and not stuffing your resume
with keywords, right? So, keywords only
help
if they read naturally.
And ATS systems and recruiters
really do ignore keyword dumping.
So, Here's
how here's how you can integrate these
keywords in clean ways.
So
add tools to your summary
skilled in React NodeJS REST API
integration.
Add keywords to your skill skills
section in order of importance.
React, JavaScript, Node.js, SQL, Git
APIs.
Add keywords
into bullets with context.
Built REST API endpoints
using NodeJS
and Express.
created test cases and automated
regression tests using just
match terminology exactly.
If the job description says typescript,
do not say TS, don't abbreviate it.
Right?
So,
here's an example.
Worked on backend routes.
That's the before.
After built and tested backend API
routes using NodeJS, Express and
MongoDB.
Another before and after
did manual testing.
The after
designed manual test cases
and API tests using Postman to validate
data accuracy.
good at this. I'm just gonna say it just
it flows off your tongue so easily.
I mean, honestly, I'm not smart. I'm not
a developer. And I've also
very rarely recruited for tech.
Guys, this is chat GPT
[clears throat]
asked a lot of questions.
>> I was gonna say you sound like you've
been recruiting for tech for years.
>> Yeah. Now,
>> going forward, are we only doing this
class on Wednesdays now?
>> Yes.
>> Okay.
>> Yes.
>> So,
choose take your one job posting from
earlier.
>> Okay. So, Michelle, what I I did is I
asked everyone to pull a job description
of maybe a job that everyone has been
uh
either applied to or looks interesting
to them or just, you know, pulls it. You
know, you look on Indeed or LinkedIn,
you pull a job description.
>> Now,
update
one of the following sections of your
resume,
either your summary,
your skills section,
or your or one experience bullet.
Now,
use at least two job specific keywords.
[clears throat]
Okay, so I'm going to put this in the
chat.
There you have it. The reference
And now
any of you who feel confident
and want to share,
paste your updates in the chat
and we'll all give some feedback.
So I'll give you all a few minutes to do
that.
Take your time. It's not a race.
That all night.
Wish we did, but we don't.
I would say we don't have long enough
with you.
Quick question. At what point does your
summary
get to be too long?
I mean,
>> yes. So, we covered that uh last week.
>> Okay.
>> Um there is a structure.
Um, let me see if I can look in the chat
and see if that's still there.
Maybe
give me a second. Ah,
>> I really am sorry. I missed out on the
meetings. Okay, so
>> no worries. That's why they're recorded.
So if you can um find them but here is
the structure
>> and that that definitely answers your
question.
>> Okay.
>> Now really they say four to five
sentences.
I think you could go to you know six
seven.
Okay.
All right. How's everyone doing here? Do
you need a little bit more time?
>> Yes.
>> Yeah, I do.
I'm going to give you all one more
minute. Sorry. Because we have only 15
minutes left.
We need to cover a little bit more.
Okay.
So, anyone
would anyone like to share what you came
up with?
I'll I'll go.
>> Okay.
>> You mind? I updated my summary a little
bit.
>> Okay.
>> I just said
>> before
and put it in the chat.
>> Before and after.
>> Yeah.
>> Okay.
Let me put it in the chat. One second.
>> Thank you.
I just
Okay. It's not very good because but I I
didn't I have a lot of keywords but I
tried it.
>> All right. So the before
web development intern at check techjoy
academy interested in digital
microbiology passionate about HTML and
CSS. Okay. So
let's look at the structure that we
talked about last week that Mindy was
questioning.
And now let's also look at the after.
Created and kept up customer
relationships by building a training
module on inclusivity in the workplace.
Design digital solution on the web using
WordPress buddy boss and ASA.
Okay. So line one
in the after
doing
>> who you are and your main focus
not there.
>> Yeah.
>> Right. Line two what you do well
including tools
or skills
>> somewhat.
Line three, proof of impact or
contribution.
>> Um, kind of.
>> Yeah.
>> Not impact though,
>> right? And now line four or five, what
you want next and how you want to add
value.
Now
I'm going to
use what we came up for David. I'm
actually editing his resume in real time
as I wait for you all to finish.
[laughter]
But here
is a beautiful example
of what we should be seeing as a
summary,
right?
Now
Amat
I know you're incredibly intelligent
creative person. I've speaken to I've
spoken to you multiple times
brother please
throw it in chat GBT that is why the
technology is there
and how we came up with this
summary
is we took his original summary which
was pretty impressive already
we threw it into chat GBT and We asked
ChachuT,
we are rewrite
this summary for a resume.
And you know what? You don't just say
that. You go in depth with AI. People
think, "Oh, you threw something in.
It'll spit something incredible out."
No, no, no, no. You have to add context.
You have to talk about who you are.
this technology AI and chat and and and
the AI within chat GBT
it understands
it it it can speak emotionally but you
have to tell it who you are you have to
talk about who you are
you have to tell this per this AI tool
I am
I'm passionate I I am interested in
digital microbiology and I'm passionate
about HTML and CSS. This is the degree
in education I have. This is what I'm
doing now. This is what I'd want to
transition into. I want to help people.
I want to do this. I want to do this.
Make sure that you express my passions,
my skills,
what I was doing before, what I'm doing
now, and where I want to go in this
summary. And and what you do is you copy
and paste this exact thing that I copy
and pasted at 6:42 p.m. You copy and
paste. You say, "Use this simple
structure
to craft this summary." And you copy and
paste line one, line two, line three,
line four, or five. You copy and paste
that all in.
And all of you who were were there when
we crafted this, David, where are you?
this I mean we ca that's how we came up
with this and and you picked David you
had I think we did four or five
>> that we we [clears throat] chose and and
we talked about and you ended up
choosing which one resonated for you
right
>> right
>> y
>> so all of you the technology is here for
you to use.
It's It's really and and you te tell
chat GPT,
do not sound like a robot.
I want you to sound human.
I want the tone to be warm but
professional.
Talk to chat GPT like it's your friend.
It wants to be your friend.
It's creepy,
but it does.
And [clears throat] more that you are
transparent about who you are, what you
want,
where you're going,
even go one step beyond and say, "This
is a job description that I would love
to become. I would love to embody this
exact job description. Create a summary
for my resume
using
my attached resume as context. Attach
your resume
and use this simple structure.
line one, line two, line three, line
four,
and show me four to five different
options for me to choose from
my summary.
It'll do it.
>> Um, I have a question.
>> Yeah. So,
Uh what when we have all the options how
do you like what kind of options might
it give you?
>> What do you mean options
>> like options that he provides?
>> Yeah, the answer the answer is the job
descriptions. I guess whichever one
sounds best, right?
>> It's up to you, brother.
>> Yeah, it has to resonate with you. I
mean with with David for instance,
we
um we looked at a uh some of those
options that Chad GPT came up with. One
was like professional and warm. One was
more like technology and whatever
focused like I can't
it might happen in the
>> like teamwork focused.
Yeah, there was a whole like it really
actually I think it's in Yeah.
Yep.
>> Also, what if we don't know
>> entrylevel growth focused
like there was a lot
>> that provided.
Are you referring to the keywords or
>> the options?
>> Oh,
different types. Okay.
>> Hey, Ahmad, watch the video from last
week. It'll give you some ideas.
>> Okay.
>> Yeah. Seriously, it'll it'll work for
you. You'll get you'll get an idea what
we're talking about.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Because you'll see me do it
in real time.
>> Yeah.
>> I my screen and I went on chat GPT and I
put everything in there.
Okay.
So,
tonight you learned how to align your
resume with the roles that you're
targeting.
When your keywords
match employer language, you immediately
increase your chances of passing
recruiter scans and ATS filters.
So
homework for you all.
Choose three job descriptions.
Extract overlapping keywords.
Add them to your summary skills
and two resume bullets.
Update your LinkedIn skills to match the
same set.
Now again,
don't get it twisted.
Your resume and your LinkedIn profile
should not be identical.
You should not be putting your the same
summary that is in your LinkedIn about
section and plop it into your resume.
Absolutely not. That's lazy.
Don't do it.
That's an immediate pass from a
recruiter,
right? So,
you now have the strategy that
recruiters wish job seekers used.
The more you practice this keyword work,
the more interviews you'll get.
Now,
I'm going to try to get this done fast.
Um, do you mind uh repeating this uh the
homeworks?
>> Yeah,
>> sorry.
>> No worries.
>> Here, I'm going to put it in the chat.
>> Thanks,
Yeah. So,
Ahmad, let's do this quickly. We've got
three minutes.
Um,
I've got your
after summary.
I've got the simple structure.
You want to focus on full stack
development. Yes. All
right, start.
All right, let me share this really
quick.
>> Okay, can you see my screen?
>> No,
>> I got to share it. That's why. Thank
you, Mindy.
>> Okay, here we are. Can you see my
screen?
>> Yes.
>> Okay.
Uh, I am a
student
at a coding academy.
Um,
Ahmad,
you have like a fancy degree or
something like that, right? What do you
What do you Well, who are you again?
Tell me.
>> Yeah, I have a degree in microbiology.
>> Okay.
>> You had to throw that premed in there,
didn't you? Just
>> Yeah, because that was that was my
>> brother. Talk about
>> Okay. I have a degree in microbiology.
Now, do you want to shift and not do
that and go full into full stack
development or do you want to maybe do
that incorporate both?
>> Um
maybe uh just incorporate maybe
incorporate both.
>> Okay.
>> Okay. So, I have a degree in
microbiology. I want to utilize this
degree and Incorp
sorry I can't spell incorporate
this degree
into my
coding studies.
My focus
full stack
sorry full stack development.
stack development.
Uh can you throw in the chat some
frameworks, databases, coding languages
that you use that you're confident in
that you're going to be focusing on?
Thank you.
Bye, Mindy.
That's it.
We need more.
Okay. My focus is full stack
development.
What's happening?
Below is my current
place.
Sorry.
Create
a
new resume summary
using following
structure.
that structure. Damn it.
There we are.
I
will not list exact
years of experience.
Do not sound like a robot.
Be human. Warm
but professional.
Provide
four to five
summary option to choose.
see what it says.
All right. So, I'll put everything in
the chat, but here are a few options and
I can also discord it to you as well.
Few options. Option one,
full stack developer in training with a
foundation in microbiology and a focus
in Python and ReactJS.
Oh, that's weird. You analyze problems
with a specific mindset and build clear,
functional solutions on the web. Wait,
what is this? You have no I don't like
this. Sorry.
No,
it is not what I want.
Do not
craft
or
First, this is a resume summary.
All right, let's see what it does.
There we go. full stack developer
focused
on Python and ReactJS with a strong
academic foundation in microbiology.
Brings analytical thinking and a
structured approach in building clean
functional web solutions.
Contributed to workplace improvement
through inclusivity training module and
supported digital workflows with modern
tools.
seeking a role that values
crossdisciplinary
insight and hands-on problem solving to
deliver reliable user focused products.
You've got that option. There's four
different five different options here.
So,
we can't go over time per Dr. Emily. So
I am going to copy and paste this and
send this to you in Discord.
Okay, Aman.
>> Sure.
>> But that's an easy way to do it. And you
know what? You continue
to break this down. Read through it.
Look at one that you might like.
And whichever one resonates with you, if
there I I suggest taking two,
whatever resonates with you
and keep drilling in with chat GPT or
Claude or whatever AI tool, AI platform
you prefer.
>> Cool.
Was that helpful?
>> Very helpful. Yes.
>> Okay.
>> Also, I like how you wrote it. if you
could send me the prompt as well.
>> Okay.
>> Thanks.
>> Hey, Chelsea, I have a quick question.
>> Uhhuh.
>> Michelle mentioned earlier that um we're
only going to have you for a certain
period of time. Is she referring to this
particular session?
>> Yes.
>> They're only uh I am only doing now one
session and that's on Wednesday evenings
at 6 p.m.
>> Okay. So, but you're not going anywhere,
are you?
>> No, I'm not going anywhere.
>> Okay. Because, you know, I'm still doing
tech innovating. I know I'm going to
need help with with that. So, you know,
once I gather all that experience.
>> Sure. Sure. Yep. Yep.
>> She's just cutting back your hours.
>> Yeah.
>> Okay. Oh,
>> none of us are happy about that.
Speaking of that, I have to drop y'all
because I have that call at seven. Bye

>> All right, everyone. Have a wonderful
evening. Let me know if you've got any
questions.
>> Thank you, Chelsea.
>> Thank you very much, Chelsea. Bye. Bye.
