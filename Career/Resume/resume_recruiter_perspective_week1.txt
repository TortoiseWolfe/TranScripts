Career Strategy w/ Chelsea - Resume Series: Recruiter's Perspective (Week 1)
https://youtu.be/sGOiktiv6Oo

Hi, Key.
I was just checking that you could hear
me. I said hello before, but my
headphones were on and I don't think
they were working.
>> No, I can hear you now.
>> [laughter]
>> How's it going?
>> Doing all right. How are you?
>> I'm hanging in there.
Little bit of a long day. I have uh I
started a a job and um it's been a
little bit wacky.
So, I'm like feel like I'm splitting
myself a little bit.
Yeah, I believe that. That's
>> But it's good. It's good.
>> What a commitment to have basically two
jobs here.
>> Yeah. But you know what? That's great.
And I love working with all of you fine
folks.
So, we'll just
>> We love having you.
>> Oh, thanks. That means a lot. Um, we'll
wait a couple more minutes. Maybe give
it like three more minutes and we'll see
who joins. This is going to be this is
going to be a good one.
So,
I will allow you to do whatever you'd
like for the
All
right, let's get this party started.
I'm sure there will be others that will
be joining at some point, but
you get a private session. Um so
welcome to this new Q&A series and as I
had mentioned in the discord me uh
discord message this series will be uh
focused on building resumeumés that get
you interviews. So over the past 12
weeks we built your LinkedIn presence.
Now we're going to turn that visibility
into proof on paper.
So, think of LinkedIn as your public
brand.
Your resume is basically your sales
sheet, right? It
it highlights
what convinces recruiters you can
deliver.
So tonight's focus is on seeing your
resume through a recruiter's eye. So by
the end of this session,
you'll know exactly what makes a resume
stand out in six seconds.
So, something I would like you to think
about,
type one word in the chat that describes
how you currently feel about your
resume. No explanations,
just one word.
Good.
>> [laughter]
>> Okay, I like that one.
Hey, you know what? It happens. So,
let's start by stepping into a
recruiter's chair. So, when a recruiter
opens your resume, they spend between
six and 10 seconds on that first scan.
Here's what we look for immediately.
The top third of your resume,
your job titles and company names,
any visible metrics or measurable
outcomes,
and keywords that match the role.
Right?
I've spent a lot of years reviewing
resumes, and here's what makes me stop
scrolling.
A clear target role or headline at the
top.
Bullets that show outcomes, not tasks.
Consistency
between the resume
and your LinkedIn profile.
Right.
So, which resume are you working off of?
Is the Are you saying the one that I
created for you is good? Is just good?
>> I only say that because I still haven't
had much luck getting actual interviews,
which makes it feel like there's got to
be something that's missing from it.
That's the only reason that it's just
kind of like feeling good at the moment.
>> When we first made it, it felt great.
And now that we've had it for a while
and it hasn't been ringing in
interviews, I'm like, maybe it's just
good.
It's just a good resume. That's fair.
Um, let's
let's uh put your resume up.
Here,
let's share your resume.
>> Do you want me to share my screen with
it?
>> Yeah. Yeah, let's definitely do that.
Give me just a minute to
>> aren't trying to read.
They're trying to confirm a bit fast.
>> So, our goal is to make that
confirmation easy. So, let's see what I
missed
>> here. Let me out my personal information
because I know the recordings don't like
that, too.
>> Yep.
>> Correct.
>> That should be able to
There we go.
>> And we'll go from the top.
All right.
Switch around where my screens are. I
have multiple screens, so it's always
like, where do I put things? Where did I
put that? I've lost it.
Okay, this should be
>> perfect.
>> The resume.
>> Okay.
>> Yeah.
>> Can we make it bigger?
>> Yes.
>> Thank you, my dear.
Okay.
Did we not put a headline in there?
No, I think this we just have the like
summary.
>> Okay. Yeah, we need to put them a
headline in there. So,
let's talk about what they look for
immediately, right?
>> So, the top third of the resume.
Let's look at that.
I want to see a headline in there.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah.
Does the headline go like right under
like my name or would it be like in
place of like a summary?
>> It wouldn't be in place of the summary.
It would either be just underneath your
name, like
um
underneath your name
and between your name and your personal
information.
>> Okay,
>> that's what I would say.
Now, we may have to mess with the
formatting, but
um yeah.
Yeah, that's your headline.
Now,
a clear
target role or headline.
>> Okay,
>> that's going to be the number one,
right?
That's going to be what we're looking
for. Now, what's your headline in your
LinkedIn profile?
We should take a look at that too
because it's not that it should mirror
your LinkedIn profile but it should be
somewhat similar
>> and going through this exercise means
that you change bold
but
it's definitely something to to think
about.
Yeah.
Okay, cool.
I think
I think keeping some of the soft skills
in there
is is okay.
But I think on the resume it should be
you know more like full stack developer
like where you see yourself
what like the job that you want to get.
So full stack developer,
um software engineer,
you know, whatever you feel
you're really targeting at this time.
What So talk to me a little bit when
you're applying, if you are applying,
>> what roles are you targeting?
Yeah, I've definitely been targeting
full stack developers. Um, and I know it
fluctuates a little bit. Sometimes they
they're like full stack software um
developers or full stack engineers.
>> Um, but definitely full stack has been
like one of the biggest consistencies.
Um,
>> just because like once you start getting
into either backend or front end, I'm
like, ah, that's too much for me. Like
neither of those are exactly what I
want. and I want more generalized. Um,
so, so that's definitely been my hunt.
>> Yep. I think that full stack developer
is definitely needs to be in there.
>> Now, if we incorporate
one of the softer skills, let's think
about that and just keep what you have
here where you're like the headline
clear target role just so that it's
reminding you. Now moving down to your
job titles and company names because
that is another thing that
um we look for. Okay. Now
we should take away anything that says
junior.
>> Okay.
>> Yeah.
And I would put full stack developer
because that's what you're doing at tech
joint software,
right?
And
>> now for you said to take care like take
away Junior.
>> Would I take it away here as well and
say like
>> No, but I would spell it out instead of
putting Yeah. Instead of abbreviating it
because Junior the way that Dr. from my
understanding and please correct me if
I'm wrong, but my understanding of the
the way that Dr. Emily curated this
um this program.
It was with the idea that you would hold
a junior developer title
once you've sort of graduated into that
position
with the intent to allow you to step
into
a role that is not junior maybe. Yeah,
>> mid level.
>> Yeah,
>> maybe it is junior but at
a a company where you are hired where
you have a salary, benefits,
all of the whole package.
>> So I I believe that in this regard
because you're also you've also stayed
with Dr. Emily in the program
>> and you're you've moved into being a
full stack developer. So, I think that's
a great change.
>> Okay.
>> Um,
now
let's scan this a little bit because
this is where
your input is really important because
>> we are looking for visible metrics or
measurable outcomes. Now we've got
refactored legacy code for 80% greater
readability in maintainability
supporting long-term scalability
uh insured quality with unit and
integration tests has the uh increasing
projectwide coverage to 75%.
I'd say that there in that first
section of your experience there are
measurable outcomes. How accurate do you
think they are?
>> Um I tried to be relatively accurate. I
definitely I mean some of them are a
little bit more like skewed um than than
others, right? Um
>> so like I was trying to like follow the
metric that Dr. Dr. Emily originally
gave out a little bit of give like the
best metrics you can. Yeah.
>> Right. So like even like the ones that
you were you were talking about like
it's definitely like a little bit like
skewed. Right. Is is is it right in my
thinking that maybe because they're so
like high of a percentage that they
almost seem untrue or is that is it a
good thing that it it's
>> I mean I don't think the percentage will
say will give a clue that
the
number is skewed.
It's unless you have precise measurable
outcomes from data and metrics that were
run and quantified. I don't think that
you know I think that this is what you
have to do exactly what Dr. Emily said
and I agree with her.
>> You know you it is going to be a best
guess until you are able to have those
factual numbers if you pull are able to
pull them.
Hey Kai.
Um,
we are
starting our resume series
and uh Key joined initially and she was
kind
um enough to put her resume up and be a
guinea pig. Um, this Q&A series will be
focused on building resumeumés. Um, and
it will be, you know, over the next,
uh, I guess 14 weeks. I think that's
what I said. And and what I'm coming up
with. So, we're really talking about
how,
um, and what I asked Key to do initially
was to type one word in the chat that
describes how you currently feel about
your resume. Um, no explanations, just
one word. So, she put good. You're
welcome to throw something in there. Um,
but what we're doing now is really
stepping into
um my brain and the recruiter's chair.
And you know, we're talking about that
when a recruiter opens your resume, they
spend anywhere from six to 10 seconds on
the first scan. And I would say that
that's accurate.
So, we're starting from the top because
it's what we look for immediately as
recruiters. So the third top the top
third of your resume
your job titles and company names
any visible metrics or measurable
outcomes
that's what we were just talking about
when you entered and then keywords that
match the role. So that's another thing
that I would recommend is
if your title
key and the positions or your headline
and what your positions say you're
looking for is full stacked developer,
then that should be sprinkled
in there.
>> So think about that a little bit in
describing yourself.
Um,
and we continued to talk about
having a clear target role or headline
at the top. So, I can't remember what I
I know I crafted a resume for you, Kai,
but I don't know if I actually entered
in the headline.
So,
please pull up your resume, whichever
resume you're using or whichever resumeé
you intend to use.
And it I I would recommend
um making some of these edits as as key
has been doing in real time or Yeah. or
thank you key noting what should be
there so that you can refer to it and
make those adjustments.
Um
you know what you don't want
is a
long
dense
or vague resume, right? We're trying to
avoid
anything
that states
responsible for.
Um,
you know, you you want
you you want to make sure that you have
some bullets that quantify
impact,
right? So,
listing responsibilities
and showing outcomes.
Every bullet
should
follow a certain formula, right? So, an
action verb
plus
task plus result,
right? action verb plus task
plus result. For example,
worked on website updates.
Okay.
But what
works with the formula and really sort
of gives a quantifies and provides a
measurable outcome.
improved site load time by 40% through
optimized code deployment.
Does that make sense?
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah, it does make sense.
>> Yeah,
>> I think I think it makes sense. I think
sometimes it's just really hard to
identify what those things are because
after you've done it, it doesn't
necessarily feel
maybe as an accomplishment or you don't
necessarily see the cause and effect of
of what you put together. So, it's sort
of hard to like
>> dissect it after the fact.
>> Yeah. And I know that the way that the
program is designed is that you'll all
work on a particular project and there
will be a couple of you working on a
project and maybe there are a few
different people doing different things.
So it's kind of like how do you quantify
that? Right.
>> Yeah. I added three lines that made all
the difference but
>> Right. Right.
>> So helped customer emails
that could become
resolved 50 plus plus support tickets
per week, reducing average response time
from 24 hours to six.
That's the difference between describing
your work and marketing your value.
Right? So that's really what
I'm that's really like the meat of what
I'm getting to here
>> with each one of these bullet points is
should we just assume or expect that we
might be asked questions about these you
know if you're you're saying 50%
>> I mean they do ask recruiters are going
to ask tell me about the work that you
at Techjoy Software.
It's, you know, I I they may not have
heard of it. Tell me a little bit about
what TechJoy Software is and then tell
me a little bit about what you did
there. What how is the program
structured? That's what I'd be asking as
a recruiter. I'd first be asking about
TechJoy software and have any one of you
describe it in your own words. Then I'd
say, "Oh, cool. Tell me about the
projects that you worked on when you
were a junior developer."
And that's when I'm going to be going to
your resume and asking about
maybe quantifying some or clarifying
whatever you listed. Maybe not.
I think it depends on what the job is
really and [clears throat] if
there was some alignment
with keys time as a full stack developer
for TechJoy software
as opposed to and not opposed to but and
how that
um aligns with the role that she's
interviewing for.
Does that make sense?
Okay. So
again, this is the difference between
describing your work and marketing your
value. And that's the the the meat and
potatoes that I'm trying to get to here
with your resume.
Stop thinking
about your resume as a description
of the work that you've done.
It's a marketing tool. That's what it
is.
And your LinkedIn profile and your
resume, there should be some resemblance
and alignment there
between the two. Now, I want each of you
to find one weak bullet on your resume
right now.
paste it in the chat
and I'll rewrite them.
Okay, I will address down the line.
Timothy,
um
I don't think you should wait.
I think you should be working on your
res, your LinkedIn profile and your
resume in tandem
now
because you never know.
>> Well, actually in this case, I kind of
do.
I mean, the whole site is scheduled to
shut down in 27, and they're not really
letting any they're not really
pushing to let anybody go before then.
So,
>> I'm confused. I'm not really sure what
you're talking about.
>> Well, my my company right at the moment.
>> Okay.
>> Um, and that's the reason the reason
that I took this class is because we
were supposed to shut down at the end of
26. Ah, okay.
>> But now they're not going to shut down
until sometime in 27.
So I have time and nobody at work is
doing anything that's going to rock the
boat or get them on the um reprimand
list.
So I have plenty of time to work on
stuff. And I from from some of the other
um uh career sessions, I think from a
couple months ago, I already started
switching some of my linked over
information over already. I just got to
sit down and actually work on it a bit
more. Yeah. But between now and the end
of next year, I do need to get my resume
written up because it's probably three
decades old.
>> Uhhuh. Uhhuh. And if you don't mind me
asking, where do you work? It's a
pharmaceutical plant.
>> Okay.
>> So I have I have a big transition to
transition from 30 years of pharma and
chemistry and lab work
to what I do now which is more on the
computer validation
administrative end of it to switch over
to programming. So, but there's a lot of
rumor for creativity cuz I did um I can
say that I'm like a mini project
manager,
validated system, so I know how stuff
works, system administrator, yada yada.
So, there's a lot I can play with.
>> And what it so are so that's what you do
at this uh pharmaceutical is it a
pharmaceutical company? Yeah, it's uh
it's we we we make creams and ointments.
>> Are you a compounding pharmacy?
>> Uh the Hicksville site is, but where I
work, we're more the testing and
administrative end.
>> Interesting.
I'd still get going on it. I don't
>> I know.
>> I don't trust
>> I'm just saying it's it's not a huge
priority right this second.
I hear you. Um, okay. Key led
development of adi admin data management
features to improve relevance
and time
timeliness of display.
Let's see what I can come up with.
This is exciting. It's like going like
shaking an eightball kind of.
All right. Key.
Four options.
And I'm interested to hear how accurate
you think this is. So, I'm going to put
it in the chat
and you tell me what you think.
any of these resonating with you key?
>> I think as far as like the tools, option
four is closer on like the tools that
were used.
>> Um
I think part of it is like the the
project that we were working on doesn't
have any clients yet. like it's just or
like it's just the the single client
who's asking for the development like
they don't have any um users yet on it.
So like a lot of this is very like
theoretical
helpfulness, right? Um which is where a
lot of like I'm honestly my huge
struggle is like the quantifiable impact
that I've had, right? I have I struggle
really a lot to get that unless like
it's blatantly screamed at me like the
percentage went to this percent. So like
that's definitely my my biggest
struggle.
>> Yeah.
>> Key, what project is this?
>> This for Ensemble.
>> Okay. Do you guys have any I mean it's
brand new.
>> Yeah, it doesn't have any users so
>> or metrics.
>> No. Yeah. zero metrics, zero users.
It's very hard to to actually see a
impact
for most of the work on there.
Is Chelsea, is there a way to describe
something that still has impact if it's
like just hit production or most if most
of the work you've done is
pre-production
like before it's been launched as a
actual site
because I feel like that's a
that's I don't know if that's like where
impostor syndrome starts. starts to
slip in a little bit is that like you
know you've worked on stuff and that it
has been created, but if nobody's used
it, you don't know.
I mean, you don't really know how to
feel about it.
>> You feel good about yourself. But
>> I think that if that's the case, then
leave it out.
So what would that mean in terms of like
if most of my experience is on like the
ensemble project, right? And that's not
a live project just yet.
>> Don't list it if it's not live.
>> Well, I mean like I can't list any of
the skills or any of like the production
that I've put into it. You can
>> like I understand not listing here's a
project that you'll never see because
it's not live. I get that part, but like
can I list stuff about the work that
I've done on it or are you saying to not
even list that?
You can, but I think that you would need
to
focus on scope, scalability, intent, and
technical impact instead of metrics.
That's what that's what I would do.
Um
because for the most part
that's what we're looking for. We're
looking for the evidence that
on paper you can do this job and
you're convincing me enough on paper and
on your LinkedIn profile enough to
um get me excited and ask to speak with
you or at least be curious about who
this person is, right?
So,
I think you can show value without fake
numbers
because my hope was that I could throw
something out there and you could tweak
it and say, "Yeah, it's not really quite
this percentage or this amount, but like
you don't even have
data to back that up.
Granted, nobody does.
>> Yeah, that's
unfortunate.
Um because one, as a recruiter,
I would assume
that because you're working on real
projects with real clients
that there will be some sort of
measurable metrics because they're real
clients.
It's it's a challenge with time. You
know, these things, you know, take a
while to build and then beyond that once
they're launched, it takes a while to
collect met metrics so that you have
enough data points to have something to
discuss and then you can make the
assessment. Oh, we're having issues here
>> and then you can make a change and then
there's more time that passes for you to
see that improve or you know
>> ideally improve but
>> graduated from the program already so
you don't even have that information.
No, it's that most of our projects are
real clients,
but they are have either hit the point
of production, which means they're live
websites or live apps, but the users
haven't sort of been marketed
to
we just don't have like enough users to
sort of have information to make
decisions like this. Like you can still
improve a website or improve an app even
if we don't have
um
sort of metrics on it because there are
constantly things that are breaking or
that are not
uh you know done as you might like
initially. you know, you can perfect or
there's constantly new technology that
changes and shifts that you have to
account for, but it's not something that
one of us is going to have an actual
statistic to reference. And with that,
nobody else does. And when I say nobody
else, I mean like as a recruiter,
how would you know, [clears throat]
you know, that you know, she says that
she did something, you know, improved it
by 45%.
How do you know?
How do you know that that's accurate or
inaccurate? Oh, I send it to a hiring
manager who is a software a director of
senior software or you know a director
of software engineering
and I will let them know that I liked
this resume in this person enough to
pass it over to them. What do you think?
So I don't know.
>> Do you highlight certain things like
stuff that you feel like is relevant to
the job
>> for them to sort of Okay.
>> That's their job. That's not mine.
>> Okay.
Yeah, my job is to be is to scan the
resume, look for the keywords,
look for some sort of measurable
outcome, something that shows that
the person applying knows what they're
doing, whether they are a strategist or
an account person or an experienced
designer. You know, obviously when it's
creative, there's a little bit more that
goes into it because you're looking for
a portfolio. And with creatives, you're
looking for awards.
That's the measurable outcome.
That lets me know you're at the top of
your game within creative advertising.
You have a ton of awards.
And not just like pencils and, you know,
a little statue from New York festivals.
know we're talking about like can Lions
a Grand Prix
um
with you know tech it's a little bit
different
uh I think uh anything customer
experience-based user experience-based
um it's also going to I am going to be
looking for some sort of um measurable
outcome but I did throw in the chat how
I would rephrase
yours
without the metrics.
>> Do the metrics if the metrics aren't
there and it's more of like a storyried
sort of
>> I mean does it just lose the impact?
You'd have to ask a hiring manager that
question.
>> Okay.
>> I mean, you've hired a lot of people.
You tell me.
>> I mean, I've only hired people that I
know know how to do the work. And I do
that conversationally.
You know, you can tell really quickly if
somebody knows how something goes
together.
And
yeah, I mean, dedication to work or work
ethic is different, but yeah, you still
get a lot of that out just from a good
conversation.
>> Yeah. So,
recruiters work in very close
partnership with their hiring managers.
And it's not like throwing spaghetti at
the wall, but it's
knowing what they're looking for.
Some hiring managers will say, "Yes, I
want to see this. I want to see these
measurable outcomes.
I want to see the type of metrics they
have."
They will talk to you about it.
Oh, you designed scale scalable React
and NodeJS architecture for tools
connect businesses with nearby users.
Great. Well, what were
um the tools that you use that connect
you to these local businesses and what
were the local businesses? Can you tell
me more about this project?
Were there you know any measurable
outcomes? Like they'll ask you
what does the da what did the data show?
And then you can you know go into your
spiel.
It's it's this is where I feel like it's
a little bit tricky. Even if you're
running your own business um where you
create stuff,
it's you created it. It was, you know,
something was manifested and yet it's up
to the person to use it. And it's like
if they don't put the time and energy to
actually grow that business, the thing
you created maybe doesn't scale or turn
into what it could be.
Uh but that's like no fault of you at
some point. Like I don't know how if
that's the best way to explain it. key
maybe I don't know if this this is
resonating at all but
>> yeah I definitely like I don't know it's
there there's a weird thing of like
there's nothing there's no backend data
to go off of right like we're not
getting user inputs anywhere and we're
not getting like metrics of proper use
because most of it is like from the devs
trying something out to fix a bug or to
implement the new feature that the
clients asked for um without any user
information or
response, right?
And so like trying like the the bullet
point that I put in there was like
specifically for our admin dashboard
that I created, right? And I created the
entire thing. So like do I say like I
increased everything that increased by
100% because it it didn't exist before
and so every contribution increased it
to 100, right? Like because there's no
there's no metrics behind it.
>> Yeah. You then you can't list it if
there are no metrics behind it. You
can't list that there are metrics if
there are no metrics, right? Even if you
I I think that you need to find a
creative way to say exactly what you
just said
on your resume.
>> Got a question.
If if if
you're a bespoke
artist, you know, doing custom
pieces,
>> it's like you almost have you have very
little to compare anything that you do
to.
How do you go about because in in many
ways software has a very sort of similar
vibe to that. that's unique to
uh these companies or these clients
vision.
And
um
how would you go about talking about
that in a way that it would be
uh
picked up by either a hiring manager or
a recruiter so that they
I I I feel like I'm grasping at straws
here a little bit
>> because it's so such a hypothetical
question.
Um,
I mean, for instance,
I mean a lot of in in my days of
recruiting for creative advertising,
I met a lot of kids out of
school
who really wanted to be in advertising.
um
industry standard is to have an online
portfolio showcasing your work. Well,
how do I do that if I never worked on
an advertising campaign?
You have to build spec work.
>> I guess this is similar.
So
build just spec speculative just build
just create anything really that you
feel
>> is going to be relevant. already
creating within the program, which is
great,
>> but it's you will all need to be very
creative
in explaining
what you've done and the validity of it.
And it will need to be creative because,
you know, the facts are the facts. It's
a very saturated market right now. Even
without all of the craziness going on,
your competition is still pretty steep
because everyone wants to be a
developer.
It's what everybody wants to do.
So, I think finding creative ways to
describe what you've done
to get a recruiter's attention,
to get the interview, because once you
get the interview, you will have
ample opportunity
to explain
why there is no,
you know, if if it's if if the hiring
manager wants to understand, hey,
Why isn't there any measurable outcome
on here that they're going to know?
They're going to Oh, okay. Yeah, this is
a boot camp. Okay, cool. Okay, great.
They were looking working on real
clients, but you know, they didn't like
they're not unreasonable.
They know.
>> Yes.
So I was just going to ask um so since
we don't like if we don't have the
measurable like like a metric that came
of it is it more so just like describing
right like the the tools we use the
situation and then the outcome of
basically whatever problem we solved I
mean in general most of our or at least
most of my bullet points are basically a
ticket which is a problem that I solved.
>> Yep. action, verb, task, result.
>> Okay.
>> Yeah. I mean,
>> and having that result without any sort
of like metric won't be a a hindrance.
Well, I mean, it won't be as good as if
I had a metric, but would be
>> better than only having one bullet point
>> with a creative way to talk about
what you produced or what you worked on
without that data and enough to catch
the eye.
Yeah, I know this. And I I mean
if there are
some of some of the students work on
support tickets. Yeah,
that's a good thing to be able to pull
and to quantify and give your best
guess. That's probably close to
accuracy.
So, I would definitely, you know, keep
thinking about that,
you know, and your your resume should
sound like you
and reflect your professional brand.
So, that's
that's what I wanted to talk about now,
but we are at time.
So, if you would like to talk about this
a little bit more, we're going to finish
what I wanted to talk about this evening
tomorrow, but we're also going to go
through practice and and feedback and
apply a little bit more of what we
learned. We can talk a little bit more
about this. Um but
your assignment for tomorrow,
take one week bullet and rewrite it
using action, task, result.
Refine the top third of your resume.
Include a clear target role line
and make sure your LinkedIn headline and
summary
match the same target language. It
should not be like a copy and paste and
they both say the same thing. It should
be the same target language.
So again, visibility attracts attention,
but proof earns interviews. And I don't
want you to think that just because you
don't have data or percentages or
metrics on your resume that you're not
going to get a recruiter that's
interested in you. I I don't believe
that. I just think that there is a
creative way to talk about what you all
have done
without quantifying it.
Any questions?
>> Have a great night everyone. Hopefully
I'll see you tomorrow.
Thank you.
