Hello. I am just going to wait a few
minutes for others to join.
Okay,
let's get started. Um, that would be
great.
Um, Daniel, are you able to put your
camera on, please?
Unless you're driving, of course.
Hello. Daniel
says, "Not in a position to do that
right now."
>> Okay. Unless you're driving. Uh Daniel,
um if you're not driving,
um it's kind of a rule in my in my uh
trainings that we are cameras on because
this is uh the kind of session that it's
very participatory.
So, if you're not able to put your
camera on, I mean, I usually cut slack
for those that are driving. Um, but if
you are not able or do not want to put
your camera on,
um, this might not be the training
session for you
because we do need cameras on.
Um, I don't mind if you're on the
toilet. I just need your camera on.
That's that's how I run my coaching
sessions because it is uh these sessions
um are like I said, it's all about
participation.
So, um maybe if you can
>> He says he's going to blur his
background.
>> Great. That's what I do as well.
So, tonight,
um, welcome to both of you. Tonight,
we're focusing on how to make your
education
work for you, no matter what it is. So
tonight's session really teaches you how
to position education
certifications
and boot camp experience as evidence of
job job relevant skills
not filler. So recruiters care less
about where learning happened and more
about what knowledge was applied. Okay.
So,
um
you know there are you know degrees,
certifications
and boot camp experience should support
your target role, not distract from it.
Okay. Recruiters scan this section uh to
answer one question quickly.
Does this candidate
um have relevant applied knowledge for
the role that I'm hiring for?
So, quick check-in for the both of you.
Do you feel confident that your
education section supports the roles
you're applying for? Simple yes or no.
Put it in the chat.
>> No.
>> Mindy saying no. So, we already know.
Daniel, how about you? You can put it in
the chat if you want or just nod your
head yes or no like Mindy did.
Um, so
acknowledge it. I do have certifications
but not getting anywhere. Okay. All
right. That's fair. Um, what else did
you say? I'm sorry. Okay. Any Okay.
Yeah. So, you know, figuring out how to
list the this education and
certifications,
it really does matter. And this is also
a piece where your resume can mirror
LinkedIn in this regard. Okay. So, when
recruiters
read an education section,
they're not grading transcripts.
They're scanning for relevance,
right?
They look for alignment with the role,
applied coursework
or hands-on learning,
recent or ongoing skill development,
right? And credentials that match job
requirements.
I know how Dr. Emily crafted
this
uh program and everything
I just I just read off.
This is 100% true and this is exactly
how Dr. Emily has curated this program.
Right?
What they what recruiters tend to skip
is
long course lists with no context.
Irrelevant electives.
Coursework that does not support the
role.
GPA
unless explicitly requested.
Don't list it. It's not necessary.
Now for
just for contrast
an example here
listing out your
um
uh something weak bachelor of science in
biology
relevant coursework
biology 101 chemistry 2011 physics 110
10.
No, not what we want to see. Not what a
recruiter that is focused within tech
wants to see.
Strong
Bachelor of Science in Biology,
relevant coursework,
data analysis,
statistical modeling,
research methods.
Okay.
The second version
reframes the same degree to match
analytical
and technical roles.
So,
I'm just going to I'm going to put this
in the chat.
I've been doing this a lot as well, just
to kind of frame everything in a way
that
if you need to
scan back in the chat and refer to
something that I said it, it is, you
know, quite possibly there. If I am
reviewing something that you both want
to put in the chat, just let me know. I
can do that.
So, how to structure education
certifications
and boot camp experience?
Structure matters. Okay? And it needs to
be clean. So, here is the clean
recruiter friendly order, right? most
relevant or most recent education.
That's number one.
Number two, certifications or technical
credentials.
Then number three, boot camp or
intensive training programs.
Okay. Now early career candidates they
can place education above experience.
Career changers
like the both of you
should keep education
below
summary and skills.
Okay.
experienced professionals,
they keep education toward the bottom
unless it is role critical.
Okay.
So,
I'm going to I'm going to put all of
that in the chat because it seems pretty
important. And then also what I've been
letting people know who have been
attending my Q&A sessions is have a word
doc open, have a Google sheet open,
copy and paste what I'm writing into a
blank doc so that you can keep all of
this in one place. And then of course if
you do refer back to the recordings
then you can really bullet point and go
through everything in real time. Okay.
Do either of you have any questions
or even statements or thoughts right now
about what I uh just uh posted and
discussed?
>> Yes. So,
um, one of the certifications that I
have, and I realized it kind of fell off
the resume, is an agile certification.
Agile practitioner.
>> Relevant.
>> Yes. Um, after the bachelor's degree,
I'm assuming, or above.
>> Um, yeah. So, actually after
>> certifications and technical
credentials.
>> Okay. Um but well
most relevant or most recent
education. So if you feel that your
education is relevant to what you're
looking for now, Mindy, then I would say
yes.
So it could go either above or below,
but it depends because the year for that
one is 2016 and 2015 and 2016 either
way. and and I have the year. I just
don't know off the top of my head.
>> You know, it is not so um it's not
really about the year. It's about
relevance.
>> Yeah. and and it's an IC agile certifi
it's agile practitioner agile
certification with IC agile and it was
it doesn't have an expiration date
because they teach it to you so that
you'll be able to use that
>> as forward so
>> y
>> there's there's that um I've also done a
bunch of coursework through Udemy okay
>> but it doesn't really.
You know what I mean? It's kind of a
whole bunch of lines of stuff as a
>> Yeah.
>> I don't know.
>> Unless it's a certification,
>> like unless
>> they do have a certification thing that
they have, you know, through the through
the instructor, but not through a an
agency, if that makes sense. Yeah, I
would maybe leave that out unless that
it's sort of like a real accredited
um uh like boot camp or
uh class per se,
>> right?
>> Yeah.
>> And and then you were mentioning as you
were going through um the like the
bachelor's degree and the relevant
coursework. Now mine is in systems
engineering and there's a lot of
>> coursework that is very relevant. Is it
worth calling it out or just because
it's systems engineering that people
know what is involved
>> statistics and analysis and da da da da
and
>> I mean it I would list three of the top
relevant
>> okay
>> coursework you know just like I I
mentioned and uh hey Leo just want to
say hi to you and welcome you what we're
doing tonight is talking um you know
about how to position education
certifications and boot camp experience
as evidence of job relevant skills and
how to list it in your resume. Um take a
peek at the comments in the chat because
I did copy and paste some things in
there. Um, so I I we were what we're
what we're talking about now
is what recruiters look for in terms of
education, certifications and you know
any kind of boot camps that you may
attend. So what we were talking about is
what recruiters look for is alignment
with the role uh that you are applying
using that particular resume to apply to
applied coursework or hands-on learning
recent or ongoing skill development and
then credentials that match job
requirements for the position that
you're applying to. Um
uh I guess you know the thing that I
would give uh have you put uh a good
amount of attention to Leo is the
example of uh the weak and strong
example of listing credentials and what
we were starting off with is a bachelor
of science in biology.
um relevant coursework. Sure, you did
the biology 101, the chemistry 2011, the
physics 110, but what we're really
looking for from what recruiters are
really looking for is data analysis,
statistical modeling,
research methods.
Okay, so that's, you know, that's what
we're looking for there. um you know the
second version reframes the same degree
to match analytical analytical or
technical roles. So it's really
interchangeable the way that it's
listed. Right? So
at the moment we're looking how to
structure education certifications and
boot camp experience.
So, what we're talking about is the
recommended order. Did I put that up
there? I don't think I copy and pasted
that yet. Did I?
Don't think so. Here's the recommended
order and an explanation of the
placement. Okay.
So, what Mindy and I were just talking
about is the recommended order. Number
one, most relevant and most recent
education.
Okay.
Certifi number two would be
certifications or technical credentials.
Okay. And then you've got number three,
boot camp or intensive training
programs.
Now in explaining the placement, it's
early career candidates. So those that
are just coming out of university, okay,
they can place their education above all
of their experience right under their
summary and skills.
Um,
and I would even venture to say that
career changers
should keep education below summary and
skills as well. But I would also put
that for career changes changers at the
bottom of the page even after the
experience.
Now experienced professionals keep
education toward the bottom unless it's
role critical. I think career changers
for the most part are likely very
experienced professionals as well. So
that's why I would say keeping that
education to the bottom of the page of
of your resume as a whole.
Now
section titles that you can use um you
can say education,
you can say education and
certifications,
you can say education and technical
training.
Clarity over creativity. Okay? You want
everything to be clear, concise,
simple. Again, I always say this, keep
it simple. All right,
questions.
>> You didn't throw You didn't throw in
that last S. Keep it simple. Then
there's another S,
>> right? Yeah. No, it's true, though.
>> Throw that in.
>> Everything needs to be kept simple when
it has to do with your resume and your
LinkedIn profile,
>> you know.
>> I'm sorry. I'm just I wasn't even sure
if I would be able to make it, but I'm
just wondering if was there anything in
the chat before I logged I signed on
that I should have.
>> Yes. Yep. Yes, there is.
>> Yes. Yes, ma'am.
So, and welcome.
>> What's up?
>> Is there anything pasted in chat that um
>> there is
>> that you can repaste? I can get. That's
what I'm trying to say. I appreciate it.
>> Me see
I do have it in a document. I put it in
a text document and
>> Yeah, I can. I've got it there. I think
it'll
>> Okay.
>> Uh, now I think it's too The entire
thing is too long. So, I'm gonna have to
go in
segments. Hold on one moment, Anna.
Give me a second, guys. We got to figure
out how to re repaste all of this from
the chat. Hold on.
because it's like a number of uh words.
Um
what is happening? Um there's only a
certain number of of words that you can
type in one text. So one chat
right there's number one.
That's one
There's two
Let me see if I can type all of this in
there.
No, I'm cut.
Sorry guys, this has become complicated
because I'm trying to figure out what I
just pa copy and pasted and what I
didn't. So, just give me a second.
moving forward everyone I am not going
to redo these things
um because it disrupts the flow of the
over overall flow of the class.
All right, this is what I'm going to
what I'm gonna post. Okay, so tailoring
coursework and achievements to target
roles. So your education section should
change depending on the role that you're
targeting.
You're not rewriting history. You're
highlighting what matters.
So how do you choose the coursework to
highlight?
You have to look at the job descriptions
of the roles that you're applying to.
Identify required and preferred skills.
and then match coursework that supports
those skills.
Okay. So for developers let's say
relevant coursework
data structures algorith algorithms web
development databases API design
that is going to be important
for QA and uh est
relevant coursework software testing
debugging
test automation
SQL systems design
for more uh low code data roles.
Relevant coursework is going to be
statistics, data analyst, analytics,
SQL, Python, data visualization.
for career changers. Highlighting
transferable coursework
such as research methods, technical
writing, process optimization,
analytical problem solving.
Add achievements when possible.
capstone projects,
final projects,
team-based work, certifications earned.
So, an example would be
coding boot camp, full stack
development, completed a 12week
intensive focus intensive program
focused on JavaScript, React, NodeJS,
and SQL.
built multiple full stack applications
and completed a final capstone project.
This shows scope,
focus,
and applied learning. All right. So, I
feel like that is relevant to all of
you. So, I'm going to copy and paste
that in the chat.
There you are.
Any questions or thoughts on this?
N.
Okay. So, let's do an activity.
We're going to tailor one education
entry that you have on your resume.
Now,
we'll apply this directly to your
resume. So, choose one education entry.
Can be a degree that you've earned, a
boot camp that you've attended, could be
this one or another one in the past, or
perhaps even a certification that you
received that is applicable to the role
that you
want.
Okay. So add
um
add three to five course titles or skill
areas that align to your target role
or add one achievement that shows
applied learning.
Okay.
All right.
And let me get this
into the chat so you can refer to what
you need to do.
And I'm going to give you 10 minutes
to craft this and then we'll go one by
one and talk about what we've done. And
then we're all going to confirm re
relevance for each one that we hear.
All right. Any
questions?
All right, I'm going to let you guys
loose on this one
and we'll see you back in 10 minutes.
How's everybody doing?
>> Hello.
>> Yep. Good. Good. Good. Still trying to
>> Thank you, Mindy.
>> All right. you you have more time. I'm
just popping in to see if everybody's
doing okay. All right, I'll let you guys
do your thing, but I'm here.
Okay,
where are we at everyone?
Have we gotten a little Have we made
some headway? Doesn't have to be
completely complete.
Leo, how you doing?
>> Hi.
>> Hey.
>> What you got, Leo?
>> I just noticed a spelling error.
>> Isn't it? See, these things are great to
do because you notice all of the stuff
that like typos and all that. So,
>> uh, yeah. I got to catch this because
they make a a bit of a mess to clean up
in code.
>> Yes. Yes. Especially you make the typo
and then you ask AI about helping you
out making some other things and then it
makes the problem worse.
>> Oh boy. Okay.
>> That's exactly what happened in this
current ticket I'm on. I'm fixing that
that stuff.
>> Do you have anything that you can show
that maybe you did for this this piece
here?
>> Uh for here. All right. Well, very
>> you want to copy and paste it?
What
>> do you want to copy and paste it?
>> Yeah, we might make it easier too for
people to kind of see it.
>> Okay, there we go again.
>> All right,
>> the text. Anyway,
>> so we got, you know, the name of the
thing. What? Uh, TechJoy Academy. Um,
>> yeah,
>> it went through multiple branding
things, so I'm not sure which name is
the current one, but
>> Yes, I know. I know.
I think it's
>> anyway
because I did both sides
>> and
>> like detailed that I completed the
course work at the very start but
honestly I wanted to harp on like the
internship thing because one
>> the name internship is going to catch
some eyes.
>> Yep. True. Yeah.
>> And highlight how long I I was in there
for until this day kind of.
>> Yep. I went to junior dev and whatnot,
but then
>> some confusion happens, you know,
because like, oh, you're junior dev, so
you work at this company.
>> Yeah. But you know what? That's cool
because that's stuff that you can talk
through in an interview, you know?
Really, you're just trying to get
yourself an interview with a recruiter,
right?
>> Um, okay. I
>> after the seven months I list like the
stuff that I've been working on, the
stuff that I feel confident about
because I've worked at one of the most.
>> Yep.
>> And then at the end I go, okay, I've
built full stack components on the sites
when I like I didn't make the site from
scratch all on my own. I had all you all
to help.
>> Yeah. Yeah. No. No.
>> And also it highlights a soft skill too
and like work with the team.
>> Yep. No, I I I dig what you're you're
throwing out here. Um, just a couple of
minor tweaks
just so that the sentence can flow a
little bit.
>> Yeah,
>> I would say
>> no. Nope, it's all good. um I would say
completed
um a sevenmonth
intensive
boot camp
>> focusing on
JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js
JS and SQL where as an intern
I built
full stack component. What? No, I'm
going to change that. Completed the
course. Okay.
um completed a
7month
boot camp and internship program
focused on the JavaScript script,
TypeScript, React, NodeJS and SQL.
then
built fullstack components of what site?
What kind of site was it for? What kind
of clients?
>> I've worked on multiple sites here. So,
>> one.
>> Okay. Yeah. All right. built full stack
components for multiple
sites
ranging from
what kind of clients just so that you
can give a get a little taste give a
little taste of what kind of client it
was.
>> Yeah.
>> Working collaboratively with a team.
>> That's how I would tweak that a little
bit.
And you know what? Did I put this I put
Did I put that in the chat?
>> I don't think I did. Look here. I'm
going to put the example
of these text.
Okay.
All right. Hold on here.
There we go.
There. And you know what? You can copy
this verbatim really. And that's what I
mean. completed a 7month
and this is an intensive program
intensive internship program for
focusing on
JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js
and SQL.
And then the next bullet
built multiple
full stack sites
for clients,
various clients.
And you can even put in parenthesis the
type of work the clients do.
Okay.
>> Working collaboratively with a team.
>> All right.
Who else has something to share?
And you can put it in the chat as well.
I just did a bunch of like some bullets.
I didn't put a whole paragraph. So, I I
think maybe I um
misunderstood how to do the approach.
>> Yeah. I mean, what we're doing is
listing either a degree, a boot camp, or
a certification,
and then talking about what you did in
two sentences, two bullets.
So, that's what
that's, you know, exactly what I copy
and pasted. That's, you know, what we're
looking for because
dumping all of that information into a
resume makes you look very disorganized
and a bit haphazard. So, you want to
lean anything down and make sure
everything is you're listing anything
that is relevant to what you're looking
for. Now,
>> so the agile practitioner certification
that just needs a single line. Correct.
>> I mean any certification
needs to be it any piece of education
whether it's a degree, a boot camp or a
certification. How the what I just copy
and pasted as the example
that's what we're looking for.
So, I guess where I'm getting back to is
I used that over at a company where they
sponsored the certification class.
Should I put that in there with the
agile c Okay. Just
>> no one cares how or why. Yeah.
>> No, it's really just Okay. So, you took
the certification.
>> Um, what how long was it? What did you
focus on? And then what was the result?
What did you do?
Like was there like was there anything
that you did in this certification?
>> Well, you earn it you earn a certificate
of agile practitioner. It's not really
that you get it when you've completed
the training, you get the certificate
because basically what you're doing is a
hands-on
um agile learning. So
>> I I mean it gets practiced in the
workplace basically. It you just get
certification so that you can say yeah
I've been through the training
>> and you use it everywhere anymore. So, I
I don't
Yeah, I'm not sure what else to put in
there, but I realized it wasn't on
there, and I went easy win. So, um yeah.
Well, I can show you what I had my my I
guess they were not bullets, they were
dashes because that's what Word gave me.
Um, now I realize I did it in the wrong
format, but I just kind of like
just thought of the three stages while
at uh the school. At first I started
with u my degree and then I thought, but
I got that degree so long ago, let's
scrap that. Let's just go with this
current training. You know, this is it.
The current is going to have more weight
than something a long time ago.
yourself. So that's what I I was trying
to summarize the three stages um that I
went through.
Um
yeah,
>> it's
I think that
there's a habit of listing everything
you did because it seems so all seems so
important. But you really need to be
critical and figure out what exactly
is relevant to the job description and
the job that you're applying to like
recapped basic data structure using
Python
and then focused on the web projects and
you know you listed all of that. Now, no
one's gonna know what support local is,
and no one's gonna care
>> unless
it's a hyperlink and you can show
what it is.
And unless you described it somewhere
else,
like the project itself is irrelevant if
you can't show what it is and what it
solved.
Okay.
>> You know what I mean? Like it says
currently participating in tech
innovators program. It's a series of
projects to strengthen vibing skills.
What is that? Like as a recruiter, I'd
look at that and be like, okay, so what
is that?
>> Okay.
>> You know, there's that that is a
a whole different bullet of its own.
Right.
So there's I think you have to figure
out how to you know what we're doing is
we're just listing what we've the
education. You're listing projects.
You're not listing what like sure okay
you've done this at TechJoy great but
that's not that's not the assignment
we're doing right now. like you're
listing those projects that you
completed at Czech Techjoy Academy where
what we're looking for now is an example
of how you are listing your boot camp
experience.
So, coding boot camp. So, TechJoy
Academy. All right. So, TechJoy
Academy.
There it is. And we're going to go full
stack development
>> boot camp.
>> Got it.
>> All right. Now, I'm writing this out in
the chat. I'm going to enter it in a
second. Okay. Now, how long,
Anna, have you been in this program? And
how long or how long is the program
supposed to be? How long? I think as
people um I think if you're really in a
rush rush from my understanding is 6
months but I knew for me I was going to
take my time. So
>> okay.
>> So um it's been about a year and a half.
I think it it should have ended about
now because that's how mine was
originally set up. But then I decided I
wanted to take that extension for an
attack innovator. So that's pushing it
out another six months.
>> Okay.
Um, what programs did you focus on here?
Like what programs do you feel you have
a very firm firm expert grasp on that
you can list?
>> Well, everything was pretty much with
vibing. So, um, in the beginning it was
like projects where we had to create a
to-do list. So it was really just um
getting a feel of how the um the the
language, you know, getting a feel of
how it works and in it the um the the
user interface, that type of thing. And
then how
>> But what were the programs? What are the
programs that you used?
>> Are you talking about like your
JavaScript and your NodeJS?
>> Exact. Yes. Like you've got to look at
what I copy and pasted as your example.
Yeah. So, um, Node.js, um, Reacts, which
is part of Node.js, Typescript. Um, CRUD
is actually the create read. Um,
>> what is it? CRUD.
>> Yeah.
>> How do you spell that?
>> C R U D. That's a acronym.
>> Okay.
What else? And these are But I'm not
asking for programs that you used. I'm
asking you to list programs that you
feel that if an inter a recruiter was
giving you a technical interview on
specific programs, what programs do you
feel confident enough that you could
speak expertly?
>> Um
I can speak now to know the detail and
nitritty of any program. I don't feel
comfortable with any of that. But to
understand at a certain level what
they're used for, what their purpose is,
and how you can um apply them at a
certain level, I can do that. You know,
like if I want to build a a a full stack
application,
I would use something like node.js and I
would use something like React or
TypeScript to build up the front end.
And then you can use Node.js JS to help
build up the back end and set up your
your database and stuff. Something
that's going to retain the data or you
do local storage when you can use
something like Prisma which is still
>> you know different
>> I mean I'm looking at what you like
help me Anna it's so hard I don't know
why I'm just looking for a straight
answer. What do you know that you
learned here in this boot camp that you
feel confident to put on a resume?
>> Um
h
because I'm so nitpicky,
>> I think I feel comfortable that I know
enough about all the languages
um in terms of taking the vibing
approach.
So if I wanted to build something that's
really complex whatever I
>> this is just I yeah I
>> everything was AI everything was AI
centered so that's all I can tell you AI
centered
>> so Anna if you look at what Leo put up
there
>> um it would be it it would be similar to
what Leo put up there because what
you're doing with the way that Leo did
it is that he's saying at Techjoy. He
learned full stack development. You
don't have to put full stack. You can
put backend or front end or full stack.
>> Mhm.
>> You could put completed the course and
worked on the internship because you are
focusing on JavaScript, TypeScript. You
could practically copy that word for
word and then add an intensive um
intensive coursework with tech
innovators where you built your own
programs because you've done three
projects and a half. So you could use
those as other um as other text stacks
that you've used. So you could because
that's Python and that's some other
backend type um databases, right?
>> Okay. Yeah. So, you could take that as
kind of an overview,
just as a getting started step
because I know you don't feel confident
about what you're putting down on there,
but you need it to be concise
in terms of the way your statement's
going too. So,
>> yeah. And I think like you just have to
get out of your own way because you're
making this a dissertation when all it
needs to be is listing what you've done.
This is just listing your education.
That's what this Q&A is about. So,
I'm going to keep moving because this
took quite a long time and I it's
already 7:01 and I would like to
complete uh the session. Um
>> but
>> um
>> um
>> I'm sorry. I have to jump up because I
have a 7 o'clock. No, wait. No, I don't.
>> It's at 7:30 today. Never mind. I'm
good. Excuse me.
>> Okay. Okay. Um so um for
when we're tailoring coursework and
achieve achievement to target roles,
right? We are again looking to
explain how to choose the coursework.
You look at the job descriptions. You
identify required and preferred skills.
And then you match coursework that
supports those skills. Like I said for
developers, the relevant coursework,
data structures, algorithms, web
development, databases, API, and you
know, you think about what type of roles
that you are aiming toward and then what
relevant coursework you have done to
support that and then you can list it.
Okay. So
common um let me see where where are we
now? Education again should support your
resume not compete with it. When
tailored correctly it reinforces your
skills and strengthens your story.
>> So homework for this week update one
education entry to match your target
role.
remove any coursework that does not add
value
and then align the education language
with job descriptions that you are
applying to. So next session we're going
to focus on resumeé layout and design so
everything you've written is easy to
scan and is recruiter ready. Okay, so
relevance beats
completeness always. If it is not
relevant
um
if your resume language is not relevant
to the language of the jobs that you are
applying to, it's not it's not going to
matter.
>> Okay,
good. Yeah,
>> just that that that is that is
definitely my case because um I think um
I don't think what would be relevant to
like the job for web development for me
it the only parts that would be for me
would be just like my coding boot camp
certifications and later on it will soon
be the tech joy um stuff because I I
feel like um I did do two previous jobs
but I don't think it's going to be
relevant to tailor it to like like a
full stack web development resume
because like they they're completely
totally different totally different
especially all my jobs they're could
come be totally different from the
>> yeah I mean that's something different
though okay so the experience section of
your resume is is different than what we
were talking about today with listing
your education certifications and boot
camp experience so that was the real
focus for today now Daniel you haven't
been in um I don't believe you've this
this may have be the first time.
>> This is my first one. This my reason why
I came in was because um I did I did a
previous coding boot camp. That's
>> Oh, got it. No, that's all good. Now
just so that you know there are
recordings of this and what I always
tell um my my students here is whether
it is crafting your resume or crafting
your LinkedIn profile
take it section by section don't look at
it in its entirety because it will
overwhelm you start up at the top by
then your headline
>> then how you're constructing your
listing your um phone number, email
address, LinkedIn profile, GitHub
profile and if you have a portfolio link
listing that great onto your summary,
crafting your summary, making it
meaningful.
>> Okay. and then going to your skills
section because your skills section
should be at the top right under your
summary.
Then you talk about your experience.
Then you talk about your education.
So just take it section by section and
all of these Q&A sessions are recorded.
>> Okay, cool.
So you can go back and find them and it
might help explain things for you. So
>> might make things a little bit clearer.
>> There you go.
>> All right. Okay, everyone. Thank you so
much for your participation today and we
will see you next week.
>> Thank you, Chelsea.
>> You're welcome.
>> It's been a really good session.
>> Yes. Thank you, Chelsea. And
>> you're welcome. Mindy, I'm going to be
pinging you if if it's okay.
