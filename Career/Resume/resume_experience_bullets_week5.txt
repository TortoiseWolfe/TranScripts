Hello. Hello.
Hey there. How are you?
>> Good.
>> How you been?
>> I'm good. We'll just wait for a few
others to join.
Hey Anna, I'm just waiting for a few
others to join.
Oh, okay. I was about to test my system.
I was like, uhoh.
I know there's there's a Well, I don't
know if anyone's coming from Adam's
meeting, but I was over there and then I
saw the time and then jumped over here.
Yeah, I I switched uh my my times last
minute uh because I need to do some last
minute uh travel tomorrow. So,
but we'll start in just a few moments.
I'll be right back. Going to heat up
some tea.
Okay, everyone, let's get started.
Welcome back. [clears throat]
Um, so again, we are continuing with our
resume clinic.
Um so
tonight we are going to focus on one of
the most important parts of your resume.
Um your experience bullets. So this is
where recruiters look first. It's where
you show your value. Okay. Um, I mean,
we definitely look at the um headline
and the summary, but it is super um
important to have your bullets all set
and ready to go. Um, and it is a very
important part of your resume. So, our
goal tonight is simple.
You learn how to turn basic duties into
strong accomplishments
that prove impact. So that's the real
thing about bullets. They aren't just
what you say you can do. It's what you
can prove you can impact.
So, by the end of tonight, you will
leave with three improved improved
bullets that you can use immediately.
So, type uh I'd like everyone to type
one word in the chat describing how
confident you feel about your experience
bullets right now.
you know, wherever you are, you know,
you'll walk out stronger where you came
in, but
let's just share a little bit first. So
again, type one word in the chat
describing how confident you feel about
your experience bullets right now.
>> [snorts]
>> Okay. So,
recruiters
skim your resume and they do not read
every single bullet. They look for
short, clear statements that show
outcomes, right? So, strong bullets are
going to share three qualities, okay?
They start with a clear action verb.
They explain what you worked on
and they show the outcome
or the value of your work.
So,
weak bullets
list tasks.
Strong bullets
show why the task mattered.
Okay, so let me say that again.
Weak bullets list tasks.
Strong bullets show why the task
mattered.
So of a couple of examples here.
So a weak task
or a weak bullet
responsible for helping with front end
updates.
Okay. Something a little bit stronger
would be improved frontend layout
by refactoring components for cleaner,
more reusable code.
So
this is not about having five years of
experience. This is about taking credit
for what you have built, tested, fixed
or contributed to.
Okay.
Any questions, thoughts?
Is all of this making sense?
>> Yeah, it makes sense.
>> Cool.
So,
this formula
changes everything. And and I like using
formulas because it helps me sort of
remember, but it also keeps me
accountable on my resume for what I'm
writing. So, if you'll remember when we
discussed writing a summary, we built in
a sort of formula or a structure. This
is very very much the same with the
bullet. So, and and this formula really
changes everything. Every experience
bullet should follow this structure. And
I'm going to put this
in
the chat. Just get it in there.
Okay.
All right. So,
if you have a metric that you can use,
amazing, use it. But from some of our
previous discussions,
most of you don't feel that you really
do have a metric yet just because you
haven't been here long enough to
actually see your efforts um in some
sort of a a you know data metric. If you
do not have a metric, we can still show
results using clarity,
scope, consistency,
frequency,
or improvements. Right? So, here's an
example
of the formula being used in real time,
and I'll use a few. So, again,
action verb plus task plus result.
developed API endpoints using NodeJS to
support user profile management.
Okay. If you lack metrics,
built React components
that improve code readability
and simplified feature updates. So
that's if you lack those metrics
using scope
instead of data collaborated with a team
of four developers to design and deliver
core project features
right
now. if you're going to use frequency
debugged multiple front-end issues
weekly across different browsers and
devices.
And then if you're using improvement
language, you could say
enhanced application stability by
resolving API integration errors.
So all five versions are valid and
believable.
Impact does not always require numbers
or metrics. It does though require
clarity. So that's definitely a goal
that you should have
before we move into the next section of
learning how to write strong bullets
without metrics. Any questions,
concerns,
any input or thoughts?
No. Okay.
>> Now, to replay the video, [laughter]
remember everything you said, for
example.
>> Um, I can copy and paste them
in the chat.
If you all have an iPhone,
if it's hard to find,
um, the playback
then you, just a thought, you might want
to just record,
just hit record on your phone and you
can record the session as well.
But let me
>> I'm a desktop girl.
>> Okay, give me a second. Let me copy and
paste this in here.
Right, there you go.
So, how do you write a strong strong
bullets without metrics? [snorts]
Most early career co coders do not have
production metrics, right? That's
normal. You can still show impact in a
variety of credible ways.
So there
uh you can break these
ways down in four methods. So
number one scope right what was the
scale of your work
size of the project
the number of components
the number of features
technologies used
as an example built three interactive
pages using React JSX
and API data integration.
Okay,
that happened.
Hold on.
Something weird just happened.
>> I actually have to leave early, but
thanks for thanks for the advice.
>> Yeah, sure.
Now,
there's also consistency, right? So,
how often did you do this task?
An example, tested API responses daily
using Postman to ensure consistent data
validation.
Okay. Quality or improvement.
Did your work make something cleaner,
faster, clearer, easier?
Example, improved code readability by
modularizing
business logic across components.
And you can also use collaboration and
delivery. So, how did you help the team?
Supported sprint delivery
by completing assigned tickets and
participating in code reviews.
So these are the kinds of outcomes
early recruiters, early career
recruiters expect,
right?
So let me
Okay.
All right.
Here, let me copy and paste this
in the chat so that you have it.
New laptop.
Sorry,
there.
All right,
there. So you might want to take
screenshots
that might be helpful.
Um so
talking about metrics here you are if
you do not have metrics as most early
career coders do not. Now
now we're going to rew rewrite some
bullets on our resume. Okay. So, we'll
do live rewrites. So, post one week
bullet from your resume in the chat
and then we're going to rewrite it.
Well, you all are going to rewrite it
and we'll take a look at the before and
the after.
Are you referring to those summaries?
>> No, we're talking about the bullets in
your experience.
>> Oh,
my my bullets are just really just
listing technology or tools that were
used.
>> Well, this is why you're here.
So we can work on them live
and edit.
I'll give all of you about five minutes
and just take one bullet that you'd like
to revise.
I'm trying to go through. I got so many
to put out here.
Oh goodness.
So we are just to right now post the um
the bullet and
>> yep post the week bullet
and then you can also So after you
started working, after you finished
rewriting it, you can post the before
and the after.
I guess all mines are weak. I just
choose one. Yep. That's all the
assignment was to just choose one.
I I have to say AI didn't do a bad job
for what it came up with.
But I got so many these files I had to
go through
and find which one is on in closer to
what you were asking or are asking.
So again this is you know we're when
we're rewriting
We are sticking close to the formula,
right?
Action verb, task,
result.
Okay.
Okay. Does anyone have any
afters
that they would like to
paste in there? [clears throat]
All of my bullets are based off of the
projects that I did. And
um and AI just kind of like summarizing
what it is, what it correlates to, if
that's a bad word, but it's not
>> just take one. Don't look at all the
bullets. Take one bullet.
Just one. That's that's the assignment
that I gave. So take one bullet
and rewrite that bullet
based on the formula.
>> Okay.
Okay. Are we ready?
Yeah.
wants to plop thereafter in there. Okay,
I see you Kai. Nice.
Now, the truth is Anna, this could have
just been slightly tweaked
because this bullet actually follows the
formula.
So Kai before we focused on scalable
solutions that connect local businesses
and users with accessible tools. Okay.
After engineered scalable full stack
applications to connect local businesses
and users with accessible tools. Okay.
So you changed engineered.
Okay.
I mean there's definitely, you know, the
formula is definitely there.
So again, action verb plus task plus
result.
Turtle, what you got? Anything?
>> I'm working on it. I think I need to go
back and listen to a couple of the
videos I missed because my template like
I don't even really have bullet points.
What I'm pulling out is in uh
>> Okay.
>> key key projects or closest thing I've
got to bullet bullet points.
>> Okay. Okay.
>> I'm got one of those.
>> Okay.
Um
All right.
So we did our
um we did our live rewrite. Okay. So
some other examples
of these rewrites
worked on backend routes. The rewrite
built and tested backend API routes
using Node.js and Express to support
you. the user authentic authentic
authentication can't talk today.
Now this version is is clearer. It uses
action verbs. It describes what you
built and it shows the purpose of the
work.
How is everyone
capturing that
and understanding the formula?
>> Yes. No.
>> I feel like I get the formula. I think I
start to struggle with like what really
has impact
and and that's where I just start to get
into
questioning
the words, you know, the word choice a
lot
>> because I mean it still feels like
you're trying to pack a lot into a
really short amount of space.
>> I think that if you think of it more as
following the formula
and it's kind of simple. It's like,
okay, here's what I did.
This was you know this was the task or
here's the action word what I did
here was the task
and then the result
>> so break it down into something very
simple and then start adding and using
chatbt.
Yeah. So, um, Turtle, what was what's
the before and what's the after?
>> Uh, where's the top one?
>> Okay.
Okay. Um,
yeah, I think you almost went backward,
>> but it's okay.
So, let's take the first one here.
Educational platform.
See, he's like, "So, what is this script
hammer? This is just This is a
description of what it is." Yeah.
>> Yeah.
>> It's an All right. So, this is really a
description of what this script hammer
is. So, it's not really a bullet. It's
not really what you did. The second one
is what you did for this educational
platform.
Um,
and you were reducing redundancies. So,
let's
let's do this. Let's
The main idea was that like there's
certain things that I almost do like
like all all my projects I want to put
storybook in. So, I basically made a
template that had everything that things
that I always repeated in a project. I
went ahead and set them up in the
template so I wouldn't wouldn't have to
keep repeating them every time.
Um, not following you. Uh, on your
resume, you mean?
>> No, on Well, the the script hammer,
that's what it's a template that has
things I keep putting. If it's something
that I put in almost every project, then
I went ahead and put it in the template
so I wouldn't have to keep redoing it,
>> repeating that process every time.
>> Gotcha. Okay. Um, all right. So
let's me share my screen and we can talk
to chat GBT and see if they've got chat
GBT has
any ideas. So can all of you see my
screen?
>> Yes.
>> Okay.
>> Okay. Using the
formula
action verb
plus
task plus result.
Write
rewrite
the following
bullet
Okay.
All right, let's see what Chad Ch says.
Okay, I mean it's short and sweet, but
it's it's a nice rephrasing, right?
Built a full stack template. Built is
your action verb.
full stack template to standardize the
task. That's the task to standardize
project setup and cut redundant tasks.
And here's the result, which improved
development speed.
I
I feel like
you're looking at the resume in its
entirety.
And whenever I ask students
to,
you know, take a piece of your resume
and put it in the chat, it's almost as
if like your eyes glass over and you're
like, "Oh my god, it's you just you're
looking at one bullet.
You're looking at your summary, right?
It's you're you're not look in this sort
of curation and de development phase of
your resume. You're breaking it down.
You're not really looking at it in its
entirety. You're really just looking at
it in pieces
so that you can really curate something
meaningful in each segment.
And Anna didn't like her bullet,
[clears throat] but it was actually that
was she she presented the before or she
presented the after
was all set. It was a formula that was
that she unknowingly already followed.
>> Yeah. I asked it to change the result
part and it literally literally just
only changed the result part. [laughter]
>> Yeah, it's again chat GPT doesn't read
your mind. You have to be very specific.
>> So I got so many windows open here. I
got to click around and find the chat
window.
So it changed the result part. The first
part it left because I said to to you
know expound on the result so to speak
using that formula. It's like okay.
>> Yeah. I mean it's not perfect every time
and I think you have to be really simple
with your words yet very specific.
I think that I probably would have copy
and pasted the formula and given a
little bit more context
like talk to it like it's human being
like this is
the the below bullet is a bullet I have
on my resume. I followed this for
formula to craft it.
I
want to change the result to lean more
in in this direction and give it a
little hint of h how you want to
articulate the result.
I mean there's got to be only so many
ways that you can articulate
the result.
>> Okay,
>> but it says developed. You got the the
action word backend logic using Python
and JavaScript. Great. Two integrate
APIs. Awesome. That's the task. And then
the result, improving overall
application performance and reliability
through seamless real-time data
exchange.
That sounds great to me.
>> What didn't you like about it? What did
you want to change?
Well, I I guess at this point for me
because it's all just coming from what
experience I've had working on projects.
>> Um it, you know, I feel kind of limited
as to what I can say because I want it
to be real and I don't want people to
think, well, I've been out there in the
field, you know,
>> they're not going to they're not going
to think that because they can see that
>> you're doing, you know what I mean?
Like,
>> yeah,
>> I think
I think you're almost a little too in
your head assuming what people are going
to think and say about your resume
>> when it's don't it's you you have the
experience you have. You don't have the
experience you don't have. People are
going to I mean recruiters are going to
see, oh, okay,
she went through a coding academy.
great. She's got, you know, a background
in quality assurance. It's very easy to
for recruiters who are skilled and tech
recruiters to
break down your resume and understand
what you're up to.
>> Okay?
>> We can we can read the story loud. We
can hear the story loud and clear.
>> Okay? is I, you know, I just gave it two
of the challenge projects that I did um
um to kind of generate bullets off of.
Um I didn't include projects that I did
in the explored stage, which was
um
uh a to-do list um with with no.js and
next and then um the trivia app. I think
everybody here know what the trivia app
is. [laughter]
Okay. Yeah. I mean, I would definitely
it just because you worked on a specific
project doesn't mean it has to go on
your resume. If you're not proud of the
project, if you're not excited about the
project,
don't list it.
It it it's more impactful to see one or
two
exciting projects that you're excited
about.
>> Well, equal with all of them. It was
It's kind of equal with all of them.
It's like, you know, happy got something
created. [laughter]
>> Yeah.
Yeah. Sure.
Okay.
So, I share my screen. Where are we?
Okay. 6:45.
All right. So,
we can continue talking about this.
We've got 15 minutes. But, you know, we
learned how to write bullets that show
value. And I think that that's what you
really need to keep in mind when you're
curating your bullets
in any kind of experience listing is
you're looking to show how you added
value.
And that really is an important thought
because that is really how you show your
worth in the tech field.
all wrapped up.
How do you
show value?
Recruiters,
especially tech recruiters, they respond
to clarity, results, and ownership,
unwavering
ownership.
So, you know, before next week,
look at your bullets
and take it one by one. First bullet.
Okay, let's work on this. Take a day,
break it, break it out in in a over
time. Take a day and say, you know what?
I'm going to tackle this bullet today.
I'm going to think about this and come
up with a few different versions of how
I want to list this bullet.
Keep the formula close, right?
And update three bullets on your resume
using the formula we practiced.
>> Okay.
>> If you have
>> Yes.
>> Yeah. I'm just saying and keep I'm
thinking out loud. I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to.
>> Oh, it's okay.
>> I thought I was muted.
>> Oh, that's okay. Um, if you have a
portfolio or GitHub,
make sure that your bullets match the
language in your project descriptions,
right? And that's another thing. If you
list your project descriptions on your
resume, and you certainly can, it's nice
to add some context if you have the
room,
depending on how you formatted your
resume.
These bullets should match that language
in your project descriptions.
There should definitely be an alignment
there. It should be very cohesive and
and a nice flow.
>> I have a question.
>> Yeah.
Um because you mentioned GitHub
portfolio and um I have to admit because
this year I I I other things was going
on my top focus was not looking for a
job but it started gearing in now
because this year has come to an end and
I have to gear it up. Um [clears throat]
I don't I don't have a GitHub portfolio.
>> They're two I was saying two different
things. If you have a GitHub or
portfolio, they're two different things.
>> Oh,
>> GitHub is GitHub and then there is a
actual portfolio where you can showcase
your produced work.
>> Okay. Well, the portfolio I think for
the challenge that um I just got it I
think one was published and another one
I did not publish. I haven't published
that second one. Um,
>> I I think that you should just focus on
your resume.
>> Okay.
>> Yeah. Don't tackle too much. Focus on
your resume. You're you're not like, you
know, two years in at a development job.
You're you're getting your feet wet and
you're low code. Yeah. That's what
you're looking for, right? you're
looking to continue in QA.
>> I'm on support local.
>> I'm actually um doing full stack.
>> Okay.
>> Or with well AI doing full stacks and
I'm the driver.
>> Okay.
Yeah. I mean I think that still you're
in the baby step phase.
>> Oh yes. get real excited and real solid
in your resume. And then when you feel
confident in your resume,
then start looking into GitHub because
GitHub is the industry standard for full
stack developers. A portfolio is a nice
to have and you don't have produced work
just yet. So a portfolio is down the
road.
So resumeé first, GitHub second.
>> Okay. Yeah, just don't overwhelm
yourself and take on too much.
>> Okay. So, I'm just going to see if it
can Well, we know AI can reward I guess
>> that I worked on the challenges and then
also
>> Yeah, it's there as a support
>> innovator
>> for sure
>> that couple in there too.
>> Yeah. And you know, it's about showing
business impact, not job function.
That's not what bullets are. You have to
show how you can impact business.
Again, there's that value.
That is how you stand out as a job
seeker.
Okay. Clarity, results, and results,
excuse me, and unwavering ownership. I
wrote that down.
Yeah. Like if that impacted you and
resonated with you. Yeah. And when you
look at your resume, think how am I
showing value here?
Right.
So do any of you, you know, we've got 10
minute, nine minutes. Uh is there
anything outside of the bullet that
we've already talked about? Uh so we're
talking about the headline,
the summary,
uh skills,
and or you know, are you um
maybe you're looking for
um impactful action verbs, right?
There's some good ones. I like the word
deploy.
I like that action word.
transform.
I like that one.
Optimized
>> deploy make me think of like a release
manager.
>> I'm sure Kai and Turtle knows what that
is cuz you guys worked as developers,
right? In the real life.
>> Um, you know, I was a tester and uh when
it was deployed, release managers are
the ones that did that. Um, of course we
worked with GitHub hub and we we push it
to do the main and merge it that way
>> to have the build. But um, usually
release managers did that.
>> Anyone anyone have another question?
>> Yeah, I just put one in the chat. I was
wondering if there's a template that
you're kind of outlines what you're
showing as far as like the headline, the
bullet points.
Well, the bullet points I put the
formula. I copy and pasted it in the
chat.
>> I made a template for the whole resume.
>> Oh, no. I don't um I haven't crafted
anything like that. Probably should, but
you know, always, you know, your
education is last.
Skills are right underneath
the summary.
And then you list your either your
projects,
list where you've worked,
um functional resume for career
changers, that's what the guidance is.
And you can ask Google or ChatgPT
if it can give you examples. And we've
talked about that to you. I think in my
first session, we discussed the
different types of résumés
and why they work for certain
individuals. If you're a career changer,
they recommend the functional resume.
What else do you have for me?
as just since you've been starting to do
the tech recruiting, have you heard sort
of any
uh conversations about career changers
as being
uh more
valuable or less valuable
um as they're getting into tech just in
light of having more capability with AI.
Um, I mean, I
I haven't heard any of those discussions
about
I don't know. I don't age or you know,
it's always about experience, right?
because you're looking for people who
have done
what you're hiring, that they have those
skills and that experience and
understand the process.
Um,
so it's really just about
showing on paper that you understand and
then being to able to talk
fluently and with some kind of
confidence and finesse
about what you can how you can add that
value.
Because again, it's not always about
produced work.
It's about how you can add value.
>> Okay.
>> I have not heard any specific, you know,
it's really about is this the right
candidate? Can this candidate do the
job?
And it also depends on the brief. What's
the brief? What's the job description?
What are they looking for?
>> Okay.
>> What's the, you know, what is the role?
>> I don't know if this is a good approach
necessarily, but you know, sort of
pushing to sort of get in front of
somebody, you know, as best you can.
>> Yeah.
When doing that, should you be trying to
present
your value somewhat aggressively in the
sense of like I think I can do or I can
provide this for you. Like this is an
area that I could fit in well with your
team or dynamic. Obviously, you'd have
to have a lot of knowledge or
understanding of the company or their
services.
Is that too forward
think?
>> No, I mean I don't think
being aggressive but just you know
having confidence in your ability and
how you can add that value.
>> Okay.
>> Yeah. Like transforming the confidence
that you have in architecture
into
um you know a position. And I just think
that, [clears throat] you know, there's
some flexibility that everyone needs,
right? You're not going to step into a
role that you're going to be making a
million dollars straight away. It it's
it's a progression.
>> Mhm. [clears throat]
Right.
And like any job or any company you step
into, you have to prove yourself.
So, you know, there may be
um you know, you may need to
take a lower salary to get your foot in
the door, lower title or a title that
you didn't expect.
But if you're going in a forward motion,
then
mission accomplished.
>> Okay. Yeah.
>> Thank you.
>> Yeah. Anyone
else?
>> Well, I kind of figure I, you know, I'm
starting over. So, um,
>> a lot of people are.
>> That's, you know, I have to take
>> not too humble. Um, but a more humble
type of um offer that,
>> you know, if I get a from my
understanding, um,
>> it's kind of tough out there right now.
Um, I just saw something about Apple
downsizing more people and so it's like
as you know
>> that
>> you know these are highly skilled people
and um, you know, so there's a lot of
people that's you know out there
looking.
>> Yeah. Yeah.
>> But yeah, so I figure I may have to be
humble and and I also thinking um I may
have to leverage some of that QA
background [laughter] to get back in the
door. Of course. Why wouldn't you? It's
experience that you have. That's valid.
>> Yeah. Cuz the the only time they call me
is to be a team lead or something like
that. And I don't want that headache
anymore. Like bye.
>> So I prefer to start humble just to get
my door my foot into the door as a as a
um whatever the title will be. It may
not be junior dev. It may be something
else but similar to a dev. But that of
course you know since you are the resume
wizard you know oh I can kind of like
work that to you know to my face
>> and you know it's it again just try I
mean
I just do the same I do the same thing
with my resume just break it down and I
break it down all the time like I'll
literally just start with my name there
I am
>> and I have to admit y'all I haven't been
out on LinkedIn and I know you get on me
about it and I'll get to it one of these
days, but right now I'm going to get
back to my program, the project three,
but I know eventually I can't get around
it. [laughter]
