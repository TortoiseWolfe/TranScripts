Career Strategy w/ Chelsea - Resume Series: Tasks to Results (Week 1 Session 2)
https://youtu.be/odPIvVCLsYs

Hi there David. We will wait a couple of
minutes for others to join.
>> Okay. How are you?
>> Good, thank you.
>> Good.
Hey there, Leo. I'm just taking a few
minutes to allow some others to join.
>> Gotcha.
Okay, let us begin.
Uh last night uh I started the series um
uh and this is really going to be a
shift of your mindset from you know
listing your jobs to creating a resume
that's really more of a marketing
document. Right. So welcome to this new
Q&A series.
>> Yes.
Did you say something?
>> No, I said thanks for having us.
>> Oh, of course. Of course. Thank you for
having me and welcome. Um, so Leo,
you've really been pretty um consistent
with a lot of of the the LinkedIn
series. So, this is really going to
transition into
um resume building. So,
this new Q&A series is going to focus on
building resumes that get interviews.
So, over the past 12 weeks, we built a a
LinkedIn presence. So, now we're turning
that visibility into proof right on
paper.
Yeah.
>> So, last night, uh, we did quite a bit
of focusing on looking at your resume
through a recruiter's eyes. And
how I started the session last night,
and I'll start it again this way this
night, [clears throat] uh, tonight is
type one word in the chat that describes
how you currently feel about your
resume. No explanations,
just one word.
And what we're going to do is really
step inside a recruiter's mind and sit
in their chair.
Um, when I personally, as a recruiter,
open a resume, I spend anywhere between
6 to 10 seconds on the first scan. It's
quick, especially,
you know, if I have a lot of positions
that are open. I'm recruiting for a
variety of different things. I don't
have time and and most recruiters don't
to really dig deep into a resume. that
will come later
um when you've narrowed down your top
uh I would say depending on the role
depending on how many of the same type
of roles you have open you're parsing
anywhere from 3 to 20 resumes that will
eventually be narrowed down to whomever
you're going to present to the hiring
manager to review.
>> Um, and here's what recruiters look at
immediately. And this is really a review
from last night, so I'll be going
somewhat quickly so that we get to this
evening's uh topics.
Um, the first top third of your resume
is what I'm going to look at. your job
title and company names,
any visible metrics or measurable
outcomes. That piece right there was a
bit of a sticking point with a good
amount of of those who attended last
night because from what I understand
currently
uh with the joy of coding and Dr. Emily
has really um been brilliant with how
she has structured the program because
ideally
working on graduating to a junior
developer in the program working on real
clients and real projects. The idea is
for her students to land
six figure salaries out of the gate and
without needing an internship when they
graduate from the boot camp.
Um,
I know that there are projects that you
do, but a lot of people work on them and
you aren't really around long enough to
see or observe any data
or metrics or any kind of quantifying
of how you independently impacted the
project. So, there's real no data.
There's really no data that you can
actually place on your resume. So, I did
a little bit of research on that. I
spoke to a couple of my tech recruiter
friends and I will revisit this shortly.
Um, but we also or I also look for
keywords that match the role that you're
looking for. Okay, so
I have spent several years reviewing
rèsumés and and here's what makes me
stop scrolling.
A clear target role or headline at the
top underneath your resume. What are you
looking for?
Bullets that show outcomes,
not tasks.
And
until
you are working at a company as a
developer or low code position that you
are working toward right now where you
have the opportunity to really
in a way that you can quantify your
impact
showing outcomes that are
with specificity. around metrics is
likely not going to be possible. So
there are some workarounds that again I
will review with you. But also
consistency between your resume and
LinkedIn profile.
I I'm not saying that they need to
mirror each other, but there needs to be
consistency.
Um,
so
let's talk about this turning tasks
into results. But before I do, do either
of you have any questions uh with what I
just covered.
>> So I do have a question. Um
[clears throat] I'm in the um
with Key does um a power circle every
every um Wednesday morning and she told
me to get get in touch with you. Um I
keep switching internships.
First I was going to be a freelance web
developer. Then I took the Joy Coding
Academy Tech Joy and I've been in this
is my fourth different internship
and I'm now I'm in the
>> Now I'm in the low code. Oh, here she
is. I was just talking about Yuki.
[laughter]
Now I'm in the low code internship. So I
guess I what I'm trying to say is how do
I
do I just target my resume as my new my
newest internship or should I put that
I've had experience in actual coding
like JavaScript, React, Nex.js like how
do I because it's going to be
>> list those in your skills. You list
those in your skills.
>> Okay.
>> Yeah. Unless unless you are
[clears throat and cough]
seriously moving into say a full deck
stack developer position
>> and that is your your focus and you are
actively applying for those roles.
I would focus on what you are
what your target is currently.
>> Okay. because I right now I want to I
know WordPress is pretty popular still.
So I want to I want to try to get into
the tech world under like a low code
position at the moment.
>> Okay. And and then that's is what I
would focus on.
>> Okay. Good to know.
>> Yeah. So yeah. So key um you were in
class last night um and I was just
reviewing with Leo and David um what we
were going over and then that there was
this particular pain point around
turning tasks into results on the resume
and then we had a broader discussion
about that. Um, I did a little bit of
research and also um spoke to a couple
of my uh previous colleagues that are
now tech recruiters and there were uh
they definitely do have some um guidance
and opinions that I wanted to impart
um to all of you because I think it
would be you know very helpful.
Um, you know, and my question really to
them was,
you know, I I let them know about our
conversation and that there is a concern
with the students here at Techjoy that
they understand the [clears throat]
value of quantifying and having data and
metrics against projects that they've
worked on. But, you know, the way that
the program is structured, it's not like
you're really around to
connect with the client directly and
understand
what the outcome or outcomes were and
also really understanding how your role
directly affected that outcome.
Um, and you know what I let them know is
I think that they're the concern is in
that they won't be taken seriously or
they won't be believable and be able to
land even an interview or any kind of
facetime. And what they told me is that
the resume will not look unbelievable
and the resume will not prevent you from
getting an interview if you're not
listing these measurable
uh results.
If you don't list it, it will make you
look authentic. As long as you focus on
evidence of process,
scope and
as much outcome that you know,
not on hard business metrics, right?
So, you know, recruiters understand that
early career voters
and pre-production contributors often
have often don't have that, you know,
production data.
So, what they want to see is and what
they kept talking about is impact logic,
right? So
writing sort of credible bullets when
you can't quantify the numbers.
>> Yeah.
>> And they gave me they they provided some
examples. So one was showing scope
instead of data.
Right?
So
examples that I looked through and came
up with and and some they gave me
developed authentification
flow for full stack
mer app with JWT and react context. Now
I'm assuming all of you know this. This
is what the tech recruiters gave me. So
I hope it makes sense to you. Not all of
it makes sense to me.
Um built six REST API endpoints to
handle crude operations for product
data.
And what they said was this sort of
scope shows technical depth.
So really making sure that
you're providing an authentic and rich
scope depth that you are involved in.
Another point and I've got six and I'll
try to go that through them quickly but
uh two they said show quality or
improvement language
and a couple of examples improved app
reliability by refactoring
frontend components for reusable logic.
Does that make sense to all of you? Like
is what I'm saying what the the what I
discussed with them. Okay. If it
doesn't, let me know because I do have
resources that I, you know, I want to
make sure that I'm addressing your
questions and concerns. Would you be
able to share um the ones that you're
you know telling us in the chat so we
can see them written as well?
>> Yep. Awesome.
>> Good idea.
[clears throat]
>> I was going to do that after
but I will do it now. Thank you.
>> It's quite extensive so hopefully.
Yeah. Okay. Let me see.
All right. It's
not letting me post all of it. Let's
see.
Okay, here's one, two, three.
There we go.
there. All of it is in the chat.
[clears throat]
All right. Um, also enhanced code
readability and reduced redundancy
through modularization.
And what they said is recruiters
recognize those as measurable
improvements even without percentages.
Okay.
Number three,
um, use frequency
or scale when exact numbers aren't
tracked.
So, an example, couple of examples
there, debugged multiple front-end
issues weekly in collaboration with QA
team.
implemented feature updates across the
three sprint cycles following agile
methodology.
Um, and I'll since they're in the chat,
I um won't read everything through since
I want to make sure we have time for
everything this evening. Emphasize
collaboration and delivery. Show results
in terms of learning or a contribution.
Like those sort of things sound like
uh authentic and real actionable things
that all of you do in this program,
right? And then uh when possible use
project or course outcomes and here it
is if it is a boot camp or personal
project outcomes
still count.
>> Yeah.
>> And you know I made it a point to make
sure that they understood where you all
are in your sort of professional lives.
Most of you are career changers. A lot
of you are just sort of figuring out
your your life and where you want to
move in your first couple of of
positions. So the bottom line
is recruiters read outcome as proof of
ownership, not proof of revenue. Right?
And I think that that's really the key
thing there.
You demonstrate credibility through
clarity of contribution,
right? Um,
and you know, some early stage
coder, you know, resume bullet samples.
Uh, there are quite a few. Um, but a
couple that really stood out for me,
um, was
learning boot camp projects.
And a couple of bullets that I came up
with with some of the two of the recruit
tech recruiters that I spoke with was
completed 12week coding boot camp
focused on full stack JavaScript
development. Simple
practice version control deployment and
testing in real time collaborative
projects.
Practice version. Oh wait, uh presented
final capstone project to technical
mentors and peers explaining
architecture and decisions,
right? And then they even
um you know gave me you know some
optional bullets for soft skills
balanced multiple project deadlines
while maintaining code quality and
documentation standards.
Um, and then
you know talking about how to adapt
these to a resume
um for some of the students. So swap in
your own project names, task tracker
app, weather dashboard, ecommerce API. I
mean it sounds like you've got some of
those names from what I've heard and
seen in the the Discord messages.
Swap your uh tech Slack language or use
sorry use your tech slack language.
React, view, flask. Replace broad verbs
like built with context verbs,
implemented,
integrated,
refactored, deployed.
And keep every bullet under two lines.
Concise.
scannable and resultsoriented.
Yes, Anna.
>> Hi. Uh
I'm not sure if you put anything in
chat. I'm just asking if anything was
put in chat. Could you repost?
>> Yes.
>> Um let me see. Yep.
>> It's in the chat now.
>> Yeah, I wouldn't see it because I just
got out.
Oh, I got it.
[cough and clears throat]
And then
>> Thank you.
>> You're welcome.
There go. And there's the other bit.
Okay.
So
continuing on,
um, so these were examples for your
resume, turning tasks into results.
Um, now your resume should look like you
and reflect your personal brand,
right? Um,
let's review and talk about quickly
because again this is from last night's
um last night's and this is the review.
Um,
let's look at the pull your resumes up.
Make sure you have them so that you can
see them. Don't share your screen, but
this is really for you.
You know, start with cleaning up the
most critical area, which is the top
third, because that's the part every
recruiter reads, right? Your name, city,
email, phone, LinkedIn URL, GitHub, and
or your portfolio if you have one, and
if it's relevant.
I
if you have a side hustle or another
business that you do, but you're also
looking to be a full stack developer,
for example,
don't put your landscaping
website
on this resume. It's not relevant.
Target role line, that is your headline.
full stack developer react node API
integration very similar to what your
headline is in LinkedIn not identical
again
your resume should be similar your
resume and LinkedIn
should somewhat mirror each other it it
should not be the exact same thing
verbatim
uh and then you know a three to four
line summary
that again mirrors your LinkedIn about
section.
Okay.
Um,
and so last night I asked those that
attended
to
take one week bullet and rewrite it
using
a formula that I provided.
So action plus task plus result
and I will put that also
in the chat because it is directly
reflective of what I already posted.
Okay? So think about that, right? And uh
if you are all looking to restructure
and refine your resume and you're in the
middle of editing,
take one week bullet and rewrite it
using the formula.
Refine your top third of your resume
and include a clear target role.
and make sure your LinkedIn headline and
summary
match the same similar target language.
It's not going to be identical, but it's
going to be fairly similar.
Okay,
T, did you by any chance do any of that?
I'll use you as an example, but if not,
that's fine.
Yeah. So, I worked on that bullet point,
specifically the one that I shared
yesterday that was so troublesome for
me. [laughter]
So, I was just putting it in chat. So,
if you give me just a minute, I can copy
it in there and I can I can read it out.
>> Thank you for being
>> the guinea pig. [laughter]
>> Absolutely. I mean, it helps me, right?
like the the moment of like fear goes by
knowing that I'm getting, you know, the
help that's hopefully going to get me a
job, right? [laughter] Like
>> Yes. Yes. Exactly.
>> All right. Cool.
>> Yeah. So, my original one was led
development of admin data management
feature to improve relevance and
timeliness of displayed data. And that
was already like improved, right?
briefly from um what we discussed
because I think the like original
original like tried to have some sort of
unrealistic metric or it just didn't
flow like even that flows better than
what it was [laughter] like originally
originally. Um but then I uh update it
since then to be a developed React admin
dashboard integrated with AWS S3 to
provide full data visibility and
manipulation.
Yeah.
What does everyone think? I like that
because it really does use the action,
task, and result.
>> Yeah, it sounds really good.
Nice.
>> Yay.
That one was such a struggle because
like we talked about it last um
yesterday of like there's just we don't
have any metrics behind it like we
haven't had enough users or anything. So
that was the real struggle there. I'm
super glad that like we've come up and
the examples like today have been really
helpful to like spark the how else I can
change the the things that maybe don't
have a user behind it just yet.
>> Yeah. Yeah. No, and I I I'm great. Thank
you very much for
um you know uh being the guinea pig. Um
because you know we we're really trying
to
instill that your resume is your
marketing tool, right? It's not just a
list of things that you know you've done
and
um it's marketing your value and
thinking like a recruiter that's really
going to help.
So, three volunteers.
Here we go. He did it. So, I need three
others to paste one old bullet
in the chat.
And based on the formula,
I want you to quickly
see using the formula if you can come up
with a new bullet
and enter that in the chat. So, put your
new or old bullet. Put old dash what the
old bullet is
and then a new. I'm gonna give you five
minutes to do it.
>> Um, Chelsea, my situation is kind of
different because the resume I have is
is more
um focused on my QA background.
>> And so to write something for full
stack,
>> um,
>> it's not you're not writing for full
stack. You're taking a bullet from your
resume.
>> Oh, any bullet. Okay.
>> That Yeah.
>> Okay.
Yeah. And using the formula,
rewriting that bullet because
it can be done for testing NQA,
you know, designed manual test cases for
API endpoints to confirm data accuracy
and error handling
using a formula.
created automative tests, automated test
scripts with Jess to validate core
functions.
So, it's really looking at who you are,
not other people. It's looking at your
resume,
seeing where
you can
focus more
on
writing sound, credible, specific,
and not inflated with metrics, bullets.
to show clear outcomes and contribution
since
you're really not able in this program
to have users and then see be here for
the length of time needed to understand
the results the data the metrics.
So this is an exercise so that you can
work on those bullets on your own in
your resume.
Okay, everyone.
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you, Leo. I'd like I'd think for
this purpose, for this exercise of being
like super quick like on the fly.
Yes.
But I think you can
>> Yeah. The first
>> Yeah. But I think it's awesome. Like
super fast.
Beautiful.
Where was I?
Here we go.
>> All right. So, we've got Key and Leo,
David and Anna. We will wait a few
minutes for you.
One more minute.
Hey.
>> Okay. Came up with something.
>> What's that?
>> I said came up with something because I
I think a lot of it was already covered
with this resume. So, I was trying to
think of other areas.
>> Okay.
>> Yeah.
provided guidance on how to develop
regression and smooth test plans for
contract workers.
And was this the before or the after?
>> Um when I came on, I came on as to be
one of the testers and then um you know
noticed that it was like a learning
curve going on with workers from other
vendors that I was working with on the
project. So I ended up being the ones to
show how to create, you know, set up and
design those regression test plans, how
to, you know, consider the smoke test.
>> Okay. But that actually that sorry uh
that wasn't what I was talking about. So
what I meant was is
>> that initially I asked you to take an
original bullet and post it
along with the new bullet.
>> Yeah. But everything that's because this
resume that I have was you helped me
with this resume.
>> Yeah.
>> And all the bullets to me look perfect.
So I didn't have anything to do it
before or after with. But I mean I
there's I can't think of anything that
will outdo these bullets that's sitting
on this paper. So that's this [laughter]
path.
>> All right.
>> Sorry.
>> All right. So David,
>> um
>> this was one of my skills listed under
skills. My the says frameworks and
libraries colon.
>> Yeah. No, we're not looking at skills.
We're looking at We're looking at a
description, a bullet that describes
what you've done.
>> That's what I figured
>> in either joy of coding or what have
you.
>> Yeah. So, I changed it
>> to be something specific.
>> But those skills you still need to have
listed. So, you can't really take
skills.
>> Oh, I get what you're saying. I get it.
>> Okay.
Yeah. So, just think think of that um
you know while you're looking at your
resume. But
>> moving on to refining the top third of
your resume, right?
>> Yeah.
>> So, that section must clearly show what
role you're targeting.
>> Got it. So if your resume starts with an
objective to obtain dot dot dot, delete
that
is no longer relevant and replace it
with a professional headline and
summary.
That's what your resume should look
like.
and
you know uh
type your target role headline
in the chat exactly how it is now
and then maybe how you plan to write it
something different.
An example
full stack developer
react node
postgresql.
It's almost like listing your skills and
you can list soft skills as well, but
again it's listing for roles that you
want to a role [clears throat] that you
want to hand.
Give you guys a few minutes to
come up with something. And again, it
doesn't have to be perfect. It's kind of
on the fly
and also
can use an AI tool AI platform to come
up with this to give you some ideas.
It is there for us to utilize
as Dr. Emily says
right key. [laughter]
This is I just put in my summary as of
now because I haven't updated my resume
yet.
That's great. And thank you, David. But
please, that we're focusing on the
headline at the moment.
>> Oh,
>> yeah.
>> Well, that is
>> But I'll read it.
>> Huh?
>> Uh, no, that's not your headline. That's
your summary.
>> Oh, I don't have a headline then. I got
to make one up.
>> Yeah.
Let's see.
I'll be right back, guys. I have to go
and close my windows. It's dark outside.
I just realized
um in the other room, I don't like the
windows open.
Hey.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah. That's great, Key.
And you know, you're always going to be
tweaking it. You're always going to be
changing it in some way.
But this is a great start for sure.
I feel like with every project that I do
and especially like every like um like
challenge week that we've gone through,
I learn a little bit more about what I
want to do. So, I think it definitely
changes with every every project. Uh I
get a little bit more focused on what I
want because I experience what I don't
want sometimes.
>> Yeah, that's the beauty of these types
of programs and this one specifically
that Dr. Emily created because you
really do um have opportunity to do so
many different things outside of
learning code, right? Really being
involved in these projects and being a
mentor and you know it's such a great
program
um that it just gives you a lot of
opportunity and then it helps you think
about what you're really looking for.
All right. So while all of you are
finishing that little exercise,
um you know talking about and thinking
about
brand word integration because you know
really what your resume is is is you
your resume and your LinkedIn profile
is
talking about you and you are the brand,
right? So,
think about a couple of words that
describe you and that is what this sort
of headline exercise is.
And
then make sure that these words that
you're choosing in your headline that
they're showing up in your bullets and
your summary. Right? So if your word is
organized
or a word that you feel that resonates
with you, say it's organized, you can
say
in a bullet streamlined project workflow
to reduce task overlap. And if you have
metrics or data, you can add some sort
of percentage, right? If your word is
technical
developed rest API integrations
improving data flow accuracy
is the word collaborative
say partnered with three crossf
functional teams to deliver feature
releases two weeks early.
So, pick one of your brand words and
write a bullet that reflects it
and think about that.
So
tonight you practiced
part of
taking your
experience
into somewhat measurable results as as
measurable as you can making them I
would say more authentic
and building a strong top third that
recruiter
can at least see what your direction is
in 30 seconds.
>> So, you know, before next week,
start to work on your resume. And just
like you did with your LinkedIn profile,
you start from the top.
You start from the name, the headline.
the summary,
making sure under your name that you
have your LinkedIn profile,
your GitHub if you have one,
your contact information, email, phone
number, no address.
If you choose,
you can put your location, not
necessary, but you can. It is relevant,
especially if you are looking for remote
work.
Um, and you know, before next week,
finalize your top third and your first
five bullets.
Now,
underneath your summary,
we haven't talked about this, but David
did list his skills. Skills should be at
the top underneath your summary.
And this is because
there has been a huge push at
companies
large and small from startup to big
holding companies. They are utilizing AI
within their applicant tracking systems
and they are parsing resumes
with key words.
so that recruiters can have those
resumes highlighted.
That is the guidance for this new job
market and this new way of AI and ETSs.
So,
[clears throat] next session we're going
to cover resumeé structure and format
like what layouts pass the six-cond
test. Layouts do matter. Formatting does
matter. Font does matter. What I want to
say is keep it simple.
You want to make sure that the ATS
systems that have the built-in AI
features are reading your resume collect
correctly so that you're getting
noticed.
You're already ahead of most job seekers
because you are starting to understand
how to think like a recruiter
and you keep tightening every section
and every bullet until it proves impact.
We've got a few more minutes,
questions,
concerns.
So, I have a question about the
headline. I just where I'm just going to
put it after my name and just just above
the summary.
>> Um, so at the top will be your name.
>> Yeah.
>> Underneath your name, you'll have your
contact information.
>> Yeah.
>> Your link to your LinkedIn profile. And
if you have a GitHub, you list that link
as well.
>> Yep.
>> Underneath that, you have your summary.
Okay.
>> Underneath your summary, you have your
list, your bullet list of skills,
however you would like to list it.
>> Yes.
>> Then underneath that.
>> Yes.
>> Go ahead. Sorry. Go ahead.
>> Then underneath your skills, you start
listing your experience with the bullets
that we discussed today.
>> Okay. But you said that what I showed
you was my summary, not my headline.
So this should the headline should be
the first sentence of the summary. Is
that what I'm getting?
>> No, your headline is basically your
title.
>> Oh, I get it. I didn't have a I didn't
So I didn't have a title before. I just
had just went right in from my
information to the summary. I gotcha.
>> Yeah.
>> Okay.
>> Yep.
>> That was all. Thank you.
>> You're welcome. you know, thank you for
doing this class because I've learned a
lot tonight just in good.
>> Yeah.
>> Excellent. Well, this is the
second [clears throat]
this is the second session
>> of the first week
>> of this is going to be a 12-week series.
>> Okay, cool.
>> I've been I've been dreading doing my
resume over again, but now I think it
looks more doable than I thought it was
going to be. Well, you know, it's not.
Again, I think that when you look at
your resume and you look at it in its
entirety,
>> Yeah.
>> It's a lot.
>> Yeah.
>> But, you know, again, just like your
LinkedIn profile, you break it down.
>> Yes.
>> Start from the beginning.
>> Yep.
>> And you know what? Utilize
what you've got the technology that you
have at your disposal and and you know
you have
>> if you don't if you say I don't have a
professional photo
>> use Insta head shot I just did it
>> it was 50 bucks
I got
I had to upload I think it was 11
photographs of myself like from the the
neck up.
>> And they literally gave me 60 different
versions that I could download and keep
and pull from.
>> Oh, wow.
>> So, I mean, yes, it does cost money, but
50 bucks for 60 different head shot that
you can choose from and utilize in any
professional setting. I did it for
LinkedIn and so that I would have those
options.
>> Wow.
And it is important and
it in a when you are
looking for a job and you're entering a
market that you've been spending time
and money
to
break into.
Why not go all out?
Do it the right way.
>> Yeah.
>> Don't waste time.
And you know it
it's going to pay off if you really
approach this in the most authentic and
professional way that you can.
So, I will be
back next week for week two
and we will be continuing with the
breaking down of the resume and I'll
review uh very quickly what we go over
each week. Just a quick rundown. As
usual, these sessions are recorded. So,
if you missed any of my LinkedIn
sessions,
they are all recorded. If you missed uh
some of these resumeé se sessions that I
started this week, started that last
night, all pre-recorded.
And um
>> that's easier said than done because of
the way that those pre-recordings are s
archived.
>> It's like you got to go through a hay
stack at night time just to find a
needle.
>> Oh, I never I never tried to look for
them.
I'm not I'm not sure where they're
located myself, but
>> I guess one big long archive and you got
to sort through, right?
>> So there there's the one big long
archive that has all of the meetings
that are recorded basically dumped into
one um playlist on YouTube, but we
actually have also started doing um more
um center or like segregated playlists
as well. So, if you go to the calendar
and you click on the event that you
missed, there's a link down at the
bottom of that that says like if you
missed it, watch the replay and it
should have a link to um like there's a
specific job hunt um playlist.
Um so, you can check it out there and
it's a lot easier to find the meeting
that you wanted to um look at because
it's based by topic now, too.
That's nice.
>> Thank you for that, Key.
All right, folks.
>> Down the road. When you click on one, it
takes you to that specific archive. That
would be even much better.
But sorry.
>> Thank you very much and I will see you
next week.
>> All right. Bye.
