Hey there. We'll wait a few minutes for
others to join.
Hey, Turtle. We're just waiting for
others to join.
>> All right. I actually need to help
unload some groceries real quick. Um, on
a side note, I know you like us to have
our cameras on. I've been having
technical difficulties with my camera
this week.
>> Okay, not a worry. Thank you. No
problem. I'll be right back.
Hey Leo, we're starting a few minutes.
Gota
Okay, let's get started.
All right, friends.
This is week seven of our resume
clinic.
We are heading into week seven and we
are going to be
talking about
Hold on a second here. My screen is not
right. One second. I know I left you
hanging.
Who is that? Okay.
[clears throat]
Sorry guys, I'm just trying to get my
screen just right.
Is anyone out there? I don't see
anybody.
Where is my crew? There's Leo. Hey. Hey.
Hey. Hey. Hey. Okay, cool. So,
[snorts] week seven.
Let's get into it. projects, technical
skills, and portfolios. That seems to
have been a hot topic since I started,
even when we started doing the LinkedIn
clinic series. So, you know, tonight
we're focusing on one of the most
powerful sections of your resume as a
developer, right? It's your projects and
your technical experience.
So, this often determines whether a
recruiter believes you can actually do
the work, right? Screen is kind of
messed up. Sorry. Um,
and your projects it your your projects
or technical experience. This section
often determines whether a recruiter
believes you do the work and your titles
and summaries get attention.
Projects earn trust for the most part.
Okay. Now, at the end of this session,
I'm hoping that you'll know where
projects belong on your resume, how to
write clean,
scannable project descriptions. It's
important because if you can't talk
about your work, which is something that
you want to see a little bit of in the
resume, but we sure do know that we want
to be able to talk about our work
calmly, articulately, fluently, have a
nice cadence in the technical interview,
right? So, that's a big thing with
developers as well. Um, how to link
GitHub and portfolios the right way. And
then how to align your resume projects
with LinkedIn projects.
Okay.
Um,
turtle. I think he's still there. I
don't know. I thought I had four people.
Anyhow, so
>> I'm here.
>> Quick. Oh, hey, turtle. [laughter]
So, quick check. Okay, we're going to do
quick check. Do you currently have a
project section in your resume?
Yes or no?
What say you?
Write something in the chat.
Leo, how about you?
You have any project section in your
resume at the moment?
Well, yeah, I do. It's mostly talking
about the projects that we're working
here on the internship slash what's it
called? Junior dev stuff, you know.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, of course. So, yeah,
you do. That's a yes. Um, good. Now,
when recruiters review projects,
they are not judging perfection.
They're looking for evidence of
thinking,
execution,
and ownership.
Now,
strong project sections answer four
questions quickly.
Okay? And I'm going to put this in the
chat, too. So, what did you build?
What tools did you use?
What problem did you solve?
What part did you personally own?
Weak project sections
list tools
with no context.
Strong project sections
show how the tools were applied. Okay.
So,
let me get this in the chat.
I know you guys like that. So, that's
why I've been doing it.
Okay. So, I'm going to give a a
contrast
example.
built a MER stack project
using React, Node, and MongoDB.
That's a weak one. When would you guys
agree? Would you agree that that's a
weak one?
>> Yeah, that's more of just a list of
things that you've used instead of
>> how what exactly the objective was. how
you I mean it it used one aspect right
but not not everything that we really
need to see. Thank you Leo.
>> Now here's how you can emphas like you
can uh
completely
build credibility here, right?
built a full stack MER application
that allows users to create and manage
accounts integrating React state
management with REST APIs and DB
persistence.
Okay, I'm going to I'm going to give you
that
to take a look at and
chew on a little bit.
Okay,
so notice a difference. Same tools,
completely different level of
credibility.
Okay.
What did you build? Let's let's let's
dissect this a little bit. What did you
build? Right. There's the first
question. Built a full stack MER
application.
What tools did you use?
Okay. REST APIs, React, MongoDB.
Okay, there's that. But what problem did
it solve?
Allows users to create and manage
accounts.
Okay.
Now,
what part did you personally own? Maybe
you could elaborate that in a different
bullet, but I think that
that's a pretty good example
and it shows clearly
the
sort of the formula and the structure,
right? How does everybody feel about
that? Good.
Hello. Is anybody out there
Thanks, Leo.
So, where
where do projects belong on your resume?
Anybody have an have an idea? Anyone
type in the chat since everyone seems
shy?
Where does it belong? Everyone take a
guess.
Jeez, guys. This isn't our first uh
first time at the rodeo here.
There's no wrong answers here. It's a
safe to fail environment.
Okay, fine. Oh, minor between work
experience and education.
All right, cool. Blake, hey, I'm driving
but paying attention. Sorry. Okay. Also,
haven't been working on this for a
while. Okay, Blake, that's cool. Kick
back. Have a listen. Thank you. So, Leo
and Turtle, it's your show.
We don't want Blake to do anything
because he's driving. We want him to
just listen and absorb,
>> right?
>> So, placement matters, okay?
And if you are an early career
developer,
boot camp grad, or career changer,
projects should appear near the top of
your resume, right after your summary
and or skills.
Okay, so maybe something for you to kind
of analyze a little bit. turtle. If you
have professional engineering
experience,
here's Ann.
Um, if you have professional engineering
experience,
projects can live under a technical
experience section or be integrated into
your job bullets. Okay? Projects should
never be buried or treated like an
afterthought.
So
just to clarify a little bit uh section
naming.
So accept acceptable
um selection titles
for your projects include projects,
technical projects,
selected projects,
technical experience.
Right? So choose clarity
over creativity.
All right? So,
let me [sighs] copy and paste some of
this
into the chat so that you guys can have
it. And you know what? I I honestly I
suggest you take, you know, your little
meeting notes, copy and paste what I
copy and paste into the chat. just put
it on a word doc or a Google doc just so
that you can kind of go over everything
and remember. Now, how do you write
strong project entries?
So,
every project
should be written in two parts. Okay?
project name
plus
one line description of what it does.
That's line one. Line two line
two tools used
plus
what you specifically built or
implemented.
two lines,
clean,
scannable,
no paragraphs. Okay, so let me
copy and paste that and I'll give you a
few examples which I'll also copy and
paste.
Okay, give me one second.
Okay. So, here are a few examples and
I'll make sure and copy and paste all
three of these examples in the chat so
that you have it to refer back to along
with what I just previously
um copy and pasteed. So, example one,
full stack and it is a task tracker
application
built a full stack task management app
allowing users to create,
edit, and delete tasks.
implemented React components,
NodeJS,
APIs,
and MongoDB data storage.
Okay. Now, for example two, I'm going to
go for front end.
So what you built was a portfolio site,
designed and developed a responsive
personal portfolio
using React and CSS grid showcasing
projects and GitHub repos repositories.
Okay, I'm sure all of you are pretty
much doing those things right now while
you're building your
image, your
entire package, right? As a developer
and here's example three
backend
authent authent authent authentification API. This is what
you've built. Created REST API endpoints
for user authent authentification
using NodeJS Express and JWT including
error handling and validation.
These are all examples of what we
previously talked about and how to
list the projects that you've done on
your resume. And this will bring even
more credibility to who you are as an
applicant.
So
here are the examples. Let me copy and
paste them in.
Any
questions,
concerns at the moment?
Okay, [clears throat]
we'll keep going.
Oh, actually, you know what? I have an a
fourth example that I actually want to
show. And I want to do this for Anna
because she's in QA. So the next one is
QA testing. This is my final example and
I'll copy and paste this in the chat
too. API test suite
developed manual and automated API tests
using Postman and justest to validate
request and response handling.
Now, you know, all this this format,
including the one that I just listed,
and let me copy and paste that in right
now.
It this format shows scope,
stack, and ownership. It g gives
recruiters confidence without
overwhelming them, right?
It's very simple formula.
Now, let's talk about links for a bit.
Your resume
should include
a GitHub link at the top. If you are a
developer,
got to have a GitHub link.
a portfolio link if you have one. So I
would say a portfolio link is something
that you probably developed your first
you start developing your first and
second year that you're working you know
you actually are working on projects.
You're um at a place hopefully where you
have enough time to see results and you
are able to see data and understand the
results of your efforts. Right? and then
an optional GitHub link directly under
key projects if relevant. And that just
makes it easy, right, for recruiters to
say, "Oh, this is what you did. All
right, here's a link. Let's check it
out." Okay. Do not paste long URLs.
Use clean hyperlink text like GitHub uh
repository or live demo. Okay? Don't
Don't be putting crazy links on your on
your resume. It's very overwhelming.
Now, let me
get that in the chat so that you have it
and you can copy it.
>> What would be an example of a crazy link
that like what's something somebody put
in their resume? It's just like why did
they put that there?
>> I mean, if it's like a link that's three
sent like three lines long, like you
don't want to do that. Just I thought
you meant the actual destination link.
>> I got you. I thought you meant the
actual destination of the link.
>> No. Yeah, just the link itself. Just
hyperlink the link.
>> Okay, I got you.
>> Yeah. So, really best practices.
>> I think I might have a a demonstration
on that on my resume. I'm not sure.
>> Oh, share screen here.
>> Oh, let's share it. Yeah, let's do it.
You want to see that stuff?
>> Yeah. right here on the top got the
contact info, email, GitHub, and here
like the link is actually contained
within the text instead of being the
entire link which could take up multiple
lines on how long it is. Like look up
here for this doc thing that all this
stuff
normally comprehend.
>> You know what? I need to put this on my
higher screen so it's going to look my
other monitor. So it's going to look
like I'm looking up
>> because I'm blind and I can't see. Okay,
now I can.
>> All right. You know what,
brother? Just do just you don't even
need GitHub and then Leo Glenn Hayes.
Just put
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. Just hyperlink the GitHub.
>> All right.
>> And just put See, so change the name and
just change that to GitHub.
>> Yeah. Link. All right.
>> Yep.
There you go. And I can do the rest as
well. The link. Yeah.
>> Yeah. Yep.
>> Yeah. I'm glad we dug into that. That's
very that's very helpful.
>> Yeah.
Yeah. Because I mean if you can
hyperlink it and and show I mean that's
that's
industry standard technology. You have
to show you can do that. Yeah.
>> Yeah.
>> So good stuff.
Yeah. Leo, thank you. That was amazing.
I love that. Thank you. Now,
best practices only link,
you know, uh
projects that you're proud of
and and you know, the repos should have
clear readme files.
Code should be readable even if it's
unfinished. and you choose to list it,
it's got to be readable
and commit. History matters more than
polish,
right? So,
[clears throat] make sure it's
links are not broken and everything is
explained properly.
Then, you know, your resume projects
must match your LinkedIn project
section.
This is where
resumeé and LinkedIn
should really be uh mirrored.
Same project names, same tools,
same descriptions.
And when recruiters click from your
resume to link it in, they should see
the same story reinforced,
right?
Okay.
So
now it's your turn.
I'm going to give you 15 minutes
to write a clear
uh choose one project. Okay. And do the
following.
Okay.
Let me
and all that you need to do this I put
in the chat. So, here's the assignment.
15minute assignment.
Write. Choose one project and do the
following.
Write a clear project title.
Add a oneline description of what it
does.
Add a second line explaining what you
built.
uh and the tools used.
Add a GitHub or portfolio link if
available
and keep it to two lines. All right. So,
this is the 15minute project. It is in
the chat again. Choose one project
and do the following.
It's all right here in the chat.
And then when we're ready, I think Lisa,
with the exception of you, because you
just joined, why don't you just observe,
then we'll start um we'll go through
each one by one except for Jared. So,
Turtle, Anna, Leo, will hear what you
guys have.
So,
15 minutes
>> and it could be on can it could be on
any of the projects we've done. Right.
>> Correct. Yes.
>> I was just going to try to do it even
though I came in a little late. I just
was
>> Oh, yeah. Sorry Jared. I didn't see you
there. Sure thing. Yeah, please. And
again, this is a safe to fail
environment. You know, we're just we're
curating these on the fly.
This is an exercise for you to just kind
of utilize what this lesson is.
But again, everything you need, all the
information information you need to do
this is all copy and pasted in the chat
in 15 minutes.
Thanks, Turtle. About five more minutes,
friends.
How are we doing? Anybody need more
time?
Everyone there?
Did you guys go and eat dinner?
>> Can you guys hear me?
>> I can hear you. Oh,
>> can't hear you now if you're talking.
>> Hear me now.
>> Kind of. You're kind of going in and
out.
>> There you go. I can hear you now. You
like that Verizon commercial.
All right, Leo. I saw you posted some
something and then you deleted it. What
happened? Did you get stage?
>> Uh, it was a bit incomplete still and I
pressed the button by accident. I was
trying to [laughter]
>> Okay. Okay. Cool. Cool. Cool. Um, so
let's use turtle as an example here.
Now, I like what you did in that, you
know, you're you're definitely following
the instructions, right? So, write a
clear project title. That is script
hammer. Now
I personally would hyperlink
script script hammer. So I would take
this link this GitHub link and hyperlink
it
make sense. So that when you click on
the word script hammer,
this GitHub
page pulls up.
Okay.
Now,
oneline description of what it does.
Um,
now is that production ready nextJS
starter template? Yeah.
All right. I would put a productionheavy
nextJS starter template with real time
encrypted messaging.
Now,
now I know that the second line,
add a second line explaining what you
built and the tools used.
Build full stack features including
group chat
with ECDH encryption. Okay. Payments
using Okay, good. But now what
what is this 2.1
AA accessibility compliance? What is
that for? And what where is that
supposed to be? Is that
is that does that go with this WCAG
2.1 AAA accessibility compliance?
Turtle, are you there?
>> Yeah. Yeah. That's it's basically like
um say if somebody's dyslexic or they're
color blind, those are the accessibility
options that are built in.
>> Okay. So,
>> it's also like Arya tabs like screen
readers.
>> Okay. But that goes with this produ a
production ready. That's what it goes
with. Yeah.
>> Yes.
>> Okay.
>> I was changing the hyperlink too. Right
now it's going to the repo. I was going
to change it where it goes to the actual
project.
>> Yep, there it goes.
Cloud code helped after finding. Okay.
Okay, cool.
>> I basically just asked Claude to
describe the project based on your what
you put in the chat. I gave that to
Claude and like explain what you're
working on here.
>> Yeah. Yeah. No, definitely. Um Yeah,
sure.
This looks good.
>> I was I figured I'd re like you said
that WCAG 2.1 like that can be a little
technical for
>> somebody that's not actually working in
directly as in the code. So I was going
to try and like not dumb it down but
make it more accessible.
>> So I just don't know how to get to that
point yet.
>> Yeah. Now but what does it do like what
who does it benefit, right?
um
what it what does it do
and like who does it
whose life does it make better right
>> so it's for that's I think that's just
one thing I'd want to add in the second
sentence in the build well why did you
build it
>> okay
So that that's I think what I'm looking
for now.
Who else we got here? Anna
project full stack recipe management
platform description.
>> Yeah, that's projects I worked on.
>> Okay. A full feature web application
what I built. Okay. Developed a full
stack system. Wait, hang on. So let's
let's take this. I'm getting way ahead
of myself.
Okay.
The heck.
Okay. Clear title. The title is full
stack recipe management platform
description. Okay. Add oneline
description of what it does. A
fullfeatured web application for
creating, organizing, and managing
recipes with user and admin
authentification.
Okay.
Developed a full
Okay.
Organizing and managing, right? Okay.
Developed a full stack system using
Okay. for front end. Mhm. For the back
end. Mhm.
Okay.
Is there a way to simplify it?
Well, I I guess I can
kind of break up the front end from the
back end.
>> I mean, I think develop the full stack
system using boom boom boom.
Okay.
All right. I see implemented REST APIs,
authentication, database, and responsive
UIs along with comfort. Okay. All right.
Great. But the same thing I asked
Turtle, what does it do? Like I know
that it's a it's a a web featured
application for creating organizing and
managing recipes, but who like what why
is that important?
>> Well,
>> whose life does it make better?
Um,
like you said, recipes with user, like
you kind of touched on the user, but
okay. So, what is all of this? Why is
this a good thing?
Who does it help? Whose life whose
problem does it solve?
Um, I would say for people who are
really into cooking,
like um, chefs or somebody like that
that would like a personal app.
>> Okay. I mean, like, yeah, I know that
recipe.
>> Yeah, it would be great for me because I
use a lot of I I save a lot of recipes.
Um,
>> when it's totally done, um, I got it
only to certain point because ran out of
time. had to go to the next project.
>> Yeah.
>> Um I I'm going to include a shopping
list and so it can it just help them out
to whatever the recipes are.
>> These are the shopping list um
>> shopping list the items you know that
you need to get
>> right. But why is this so important? It
seems to me it's to
allow the user
to not only have admin authentification
but to also keep things their recipes
organized in one place
>> somehow explaining that
>> and there will be multiple users. So the
application um well it was just what we
had to do and so if you are the admin
then you of course you'll have more per
or permissions so you'll be able to
track the number of people that's in
there perhaps the number of login things
like that
uh that's what I want to add to it in
capacity but that's what I did and the
current one I'm working on is really a
profanity filter filter
and um
>> that one I guess would be good for
people with small
>> um form like that.
>> Yeah,
>> you can try.
>> I mean I think this is a good start
>> um for both you and Turtle. But what I
would like you to kind of add is the
why. Like why is this even being
developed? Why is this important?
>> Okay. Well, maybe
>> just think about that.
>> Okay. Maybe I should have went with the
um the project I worked on with the
camping site, but I didn't think about
now.
>> You know what? This is perfectly fine
what you did. All you need to do is add
the Y.
>> Okay.
>> Yeah.
>> Well, we're Yeah, you did it. So, um
projects are not filler, right? They're
proof.
And when written clearly, they tell
recruiters that you can apply what
you've learned,
that you understand the stack
and you can ship work.
That's huge. And I would beg to differ
or I would even add that you can talk
about your work fluently, which is again
so important because you are going to
have to do that to get a job as a
developer.
So, you know, before I
open uh the floor up to more
conversation, what I would like you to
do is think about some homework for
yourselves. Right? So,
add or refine at least two projects on
your resume. Update your LinkedIn
project section to match and then ensure
your GitHub links are clean and
readable. Okay. So, next week we'll move
into resume design and layout so that
everything you've written is easy to
scan and recruiter friendly.
Um,
what what what is this for? Uh, is this
for the same thing, Turtle? The same
>> Yeah, I just tried to rewrite it based
on feedback.
>> Okay.
>> A little less tech heavy as far as the
wording.
>> Okay. designed for startups and agency.
Okay. Yeah. Nice. There it is.
Absolutely. Thank you. What else you
guys got for me?
>> Thank you.
>> It's all good advice.
>> We've got like five more minutes, so
let's talk about anything that you
missed or anything that you have
questions on.
Anyone? Um
um I'm I'm going to confess my sins.
>> Oh no, we're going there.
>> I have not done much with that LinkedIn.
And I know, you know, I'm building up
the bits and pieces, but I know at some
point I'm going to have to get it filled
out because to next year I really got to
get serious about looking for a job.
Mhm.
>> So, um you know, right now I'm
um working on ways to to build out the
content that's, you know, correct ways
and
>> that's focusing on projects right now.
So, I can say, you know, okay, this how
I'm putting these skills together.
>> Um but at some point, I really am going
to probably need some help with that
LinkedIn.
>> So, that's me confessing my sins.
>> Well, it's all right. I mean, you're not
the only one. And I put a link there in
the chat for transcripts.
So you said you was behind on the
LinkedIn. What I've been doing is taking
what Chelsea tells us here every week.
I've been taking the LinkedIn taking the
link from uh YouTube and giving that to
an MCP server that extracts the
transcripts.
>> Wow.
>> And then I've taken that I've taken that
collection of transcripts. You can do
the same thing with a chat GPT or I can
run it run you through it one night on a
pure mentor session or something. But
basically I use those transcripts as
context. So the first time I and you can
go to your uh LinkedIn and export all
your data. And so I've taken my LinkedIn
given it to that same GPT with the
context of the transcripts. The first
time I ran it through it said my
LinkedIn was at a six out of a 10 and
out of two different pass. You know I've
been doing it like a basically every
Monday I do another pass. So the first
week it went from a six. Right now it's
up to a seven 7.5 out of 10. And it
started at six out of 10. So it's
basically taking what she's teaching us
and it kind of reminds me like the
Superman got the crystals from his
parents. It's [laughter] like here's
everything. It's like here's everything
I want to teach you and then it, you
know, puts it into that automated form.
So it's like she's there coaching even
when she's not with us.
>> Nice. Thanks, Turtle. That's great.
>> You said a CGN.
>> What's that? CGN.
>> Yeah. You said you use something
uh how you extract the data from.
>> Oh uh there MCP uh so I've got a MCP
server running in Docker. Let's see what
is MCP model context protocol. Most of
them have a lot of configuration but
there's one that's really simple.
Doesn't need any configuration and it's
just set up to extract uh transcripts
from YouTube's uh links.
>> I like that a lot.
>> Yeah, that's great. And I' I've got a
little surprise coming, but I'm kind of
keeping it under my hat till I get it
further along because basically
>> Oh, wow.
>> I've taken your transcripts and the
script hammer template and forked a new
project off of that. Basically, it's
based on the U spreadsheet that you gave
us for tracking applications.
>> Yes,
>> it's basically I've built that into an
app. So, it's
>> okay. I'm just going to have to catch
you off um you know turtle [laughter]
offline on some of this stuff because
>> yeah this is this is
>> and this is all stuff that you can
document too to turtle and showcase
>> on your resume and LinkedIn profile so
that's great you know and you're already
helping people you're helping your peers
>> so you have like real life testimonials
right so that's great Um, so yeah. Who
else? A couple of minutes.
>> Chelsea, I put a project in there in the
chat.
>> Yeah. You know what? I couldn't I could
barely see it, Lisa. Let me see if I can
open it. Let me try to download it.
>> Oh, yeah. That one. Yeah.
>> I can't personal find. I can't really
see all of it. Can you Is there a Wait.
Uh,
>> it's a JPEG or it's a snapshot.
>> Yeah, I can't and I can't download it
either.
>> You can take a screenshot.
>> I mean, I can see it, but I can't
>> A lot of it cuts off.
>> Yeah, but you can take a screenshot of
your chat window. Just blow your chat
window up, you know, zoom it out and
then take a screenshot. That's what I
did.
>> Yeah.
Um,
I mean, I can kind of see and I see that
you described it, which is great, but
what I really want to see again, and if
you kind of you you didn't you came in,
you know, like kind of halfway, so you
didn't get sort of the full
explanation, but
what you want to hear is what you built,
what tools did you use, what problem did
you solve? That's the why.
>> Mhm.
>> What part did you personally own?
So,
>> okay,
>> you know, like some of the examples, if
you scroll through the chat, there was
one example that I gave. So the weak uh
example is built a mer stack project
using react node and mongodb
that's only yes we know what you built
and we know the tools that you used but
there's like what problem did you solve
they didn't really cover that and that's
what's important that's the why so
here's a strong example built a full
stack m application that allows ows
users
to create and manage accounts
integrating
React
state management with REST APIs and
MongoDB persistence.
I just want to kind of caution all of
you that this isn't a place where you
kind of vomit every
database, every stack that you've used
to be impressive.
It's less is more, right?
>> So, you give a t like a taste or um a
moose boost.
It's just simple. It's really following
a formula. What did you build?
I don't see that here. Unless I'm I'm
missing it, uh, Lisa, because a lot is
cut off. I don't see even what you
built. I mean, I know Buddy is a
comprehensive
web-based
I can't see what it says after that. And
then it says management application
designed to help
I I Yeah. Oh,
>> okay. So, it says um it doesn't have any
it Well, it's the
I ran we ran this through chat GPT and
we got um the Budget Buddy is a
comprehensive web-based uh personal
finance management application designed
to help users track their income,
expenses, and saving goals with an
intuitive visual interface.
>> Okay. But you built
>> So you built
>> built a comprehensive webbased
>> that's what you built.
>> Okay.
>> It's not I mean yes you're describing
the project but you're talking about
what you did.
>> So you this is what you built
>> and now
what tools did you use? You have to add
that. I don't see that. But again, I
can't see the full
um
>> Okay.
>> the full screenshot or whatever you put
in here. And then
>> yeah, I don't see there.
>> And then I think it says
>> I think it says designed to help. So
that's the why.
>> What problem did it solve? That's the
why.
So yeah, I would get those. Um
>> I actually showed this one off to a
couple people at church and they
actually like it. They said that's
pretty cool.
>> So um um
>> very good
>> for a vibe, you know, for a vibe session
with a team of people in four days. That
was pretty It's a pretty good little
app.
>> So um I'm going to I mean you know Anna,
you can include this one as well. So
because this is me and you on this one
as well. So,
>> excellent. Yeah, I mean I would just
make those few tweaks.
>> Okay.
>> Um I do want to get to Leo Leo
Famigo Famigo.
I would hyperlink that.
>> Okay. So, don't
>> I've been trying to figure out how to do
that on the actual chat here.
>> Ah, okay. Cool. Cool.
>> Okay, you guys. I'm sorry. I'm got to
jump out. I got a 7:00.
>> Sure. Bye, Anna.
So, what I would adjust, Leo, is built a
listing site for family friendly
friendly vacation spots, letting
families find
>> and leave. So, that's what you did,
right? And then
implement the implementation of
Typescript and React for the UI when
implementing the forgot password. Yeah,
I think this could be tweaked a little
bit. also
>> or talk about the stack used right like
using that language.
>> Um okay friends we need to stop.
So I hope this was beneficial for all of
you. I hope to see all of you in my
other my next session next Wednesday at
6 PM. Um, please have a beautiful night
and you can find me on Discord if you
need to ask any questions.
>> Cool.
>> Hey, I just sent over mine. I I didn't
hyperlink the title because I didn't
have time and everything like that, but
I just wanted to get a just an idea if
if this looks okay like the format wise.
>> Uh yeah, I don't think you need to put I
but you can built and developed a
back-end logistics
automation platform designed to
streamline shipping cost analysis and
delivery time forecasting for small and
medium-siz businesses. Yes. Everything.
Yeah. This is what you did.
Yep.
Excellent. But
>> yeah, thank you.
>> Yeah, you're welcome. Definitely. That's
that's the cadence that we're looking
for there.
>> Cool. Thank you. I appreciate it.
>> Thank you. And um everyone have a great
night and we'll see you next Wednesday
hopefully. Yeah. Glad you liked it. Talk
