Get
Hello.
>> Hey.
>> Hello.
>> All right. We'll give um we'll do just a
couple more minutes waiting for others
to join. See if there are others to
join. So, I'll be right there.
>> Sure.
Okay, let's get started. Um, there might
be some other people that are going to
um come in.
Who is here now? Leo, are you here as
well?
>> Yeah.
>> Okay, there you are. Um, sorry. I have
my I have my screen minimized
um a little bit here. So, Tushar, is
that who you pronounce that? Tar.
>> All right. Fantastic. So, um this
evening we are picking up where we left
off a few weeks ago before the holidays.
So, it's been a little bit of time. We
are in week nine of our resume clinic.
we've been covering quite a bit. So, um,
Tushar, you may want to go back and or
research how to obtain the recordings
for, um, all of my Q&A sessions that I
do. Um, I was doing them on Tuesdays and
Wednesdays. Now, I'm only on Wednesdays
at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. But
there are these all are recorded and I
am covering this is basically week nine
of our resume clinic. So you might want
to go back to week one and it really
breaks everything down. Um but tonight
is actually a great session because
we're talking about resumeé layouts and
um design principles.
>> Okay. Um, so,
um,
>> we do have one if I if you want me to
upload it and send it to you.
>> Um, yeah, you can do that. You can
actually forward it to me in Discord,
um, if you'd like.
>> Sure.
>> So, um, tonight we are focusing on, as I
said, resume layout and design.
>> Um, this is really one of the fastest
ways to improve your resume without
rewriting any content. like this is the
fun stuff to be honest. Um, a clean
layout keeps recruiters reading. Um, a
cluttered layout makes them stop. And I
can tell you from currently being a
recruiter and being a recruiter for 20
plus years, I 100% look at the
simplicity of someone's resume. Unless
you are a designer,
I don't want to see design on your
resume. And even if you're a designer,
that's even
that's
just keep it simple. I've been saying
this the entire time. Even when we were
talking um uh about LinkedIn in our
LinkedIn clinic, less is more. Always
remember that.
Um,
and
one of the biggest things and something
that I've actually been seeing with a
lot of younger
um, state side applicants,
they're putting their picture, their
photo on their resume. Don't do that.
Don't don't don't do that. That is a
European uh thing. That is what they do.
You do not do that here. If you are
going to uh or if you feel compelled to
uh put your photograph anywhere, it
should be placed in your online
portfolio. Not your GitHub, but your
online portfolio in a section that is
your about section.
That's the appropriate place to put it.
Now,
you know, the goal is to not make your
resume look flashy. The goal is to make
your content easier to read, easier to
trust, and easier to remember. Now,
quick poll. Are you currently using a
resume template or something you built
yourself?
Put it in the chat. Type template or
custom.
Okay. Neil's using a template.
Is this the template I gave you?
>> Uh, yes. Well,
>> sort of. Yes and no. Right.
>> It's the template that I've been using
forever from the previous boot camp I
was in, which then you helped mess
around with and now I have now.
Gotcha. All right. Cool. Cool. Cool.
Cool. All right. What do we got? Who
else?
Okay.
Ré builder. Okay. All right. Um again,
to definitely go back and take a look.
Um because these resume builders
typically are antiquated
and
don't consider the fact that AI is now
reviewing résumés and applicant tracking
systems and it's you know not really
telling you the wise behind the
positioning between certain uh segments
of your resume.
Now, um, thank you everyone for sharing
that. I appreciate it.
Um, now
recruiters do not read resumes from top
to bottom, okay? They scan.
Most scans follow a pattern.
top third of the page, section headers,
job titles in dates,
and first bullet or two under each role.
Now, your layout either supports the
scan or fights it. If a recruiter has to
work to understand your resume, they
move on.
Confirming.
Yes.
So
the ATS reality,
what's an ATS? Applicant tracking
system.
So when you apply to a role, whether
through LinkedIn, Indeed, or if you're
applying directly on a company's career
page, your application is then deposited
in something called an applicant
tracking system. There are many many
applicant tracking systems. There's
something called Ashby,
Greenhouse,
Job Vite.
Gosh, what other ones have I used?
Work work something
that was sued. Workday.
Workday has a lot of lawsuits.
Um, yeah. So applicant tracking systems
read line by line. Okay.
They struggle with tables, text boxes,
graphics,
some columns if they're too complicated,
um, and tables. So even if a resume
looks nice to you, it may be unreadable
to software.
So that's definitely something that uh
you should think about.
So some core design rules that every
resume should follow. So these rules
apply to nearly every resume in today's
market.
Font.
Use one font only.
Stick to Ariel Collabri or Helvetica.
something very simple.
Uh 10.5 to 12 for body text and slightly
larger for section headers.
Okay, these fonts are readable,
they're professional,
and more importantly, they're ATS safe.
Color:
black or dark gray text. No colored
section headers. No background shading.
Okay. Now, color
distracts from content and breaks the
scanning patterns.
So, that's why we like to keep
everything nice and clean and simple.
Um, this is really for applicant
tracking systems. And now you know the
formatting. So, use bold
for section headers and job titles.
Avoid italics
or for large blocks of texts.
No underlines except hyperlinks.
Okay.
>> While you're on color, um, what about
like the the hyperlinks? They're they
would usually be in blue with the ATS.
Have a problem with those? I would I
would make them black.
>> Okay.
>> Yeah, good question. Now, bold guides
the eye.
Colors confuse it.
Okay.
And now layout.
Single column layout.
Left aligned text.
Consistent spacing between sections.
Symmetry, believe it or not, builds
trust. Inconsistent spacing signals
carelessness and sloppiness.
Now,
if you, you know, are dead set on
designing your resume and making it
colorful and what have you.
I always suggest that you leave that
tech that type of resume for when you
are interviewing in person and maybe you
want to
give a little bit more
oomph.
I personally don't I would just keep
everything consistent across the board
and leave the ump to your online
portfolio where you put your about
section. If you want to show your
creative side, do it there.
But again,
um, unless you are
creatives,
um, artists,
designers, art directors,
leave the creative out of it. If you're
not a creative, don't try to be.
It does. It never flies.
um noisy versus clean layout.
So
I'll give you a few examples.
Now describe
let me describe to you a noisy
resume.
Two columns,
icons for phone and email, skill bars,
multiple fonts, tight spacing.
Clean resume has one column,
clear section headers,
consistent bullet spacing,
and simple margins.
Now, which one is easier to scan in 5
seconds? Which one do you think?
The clean one.
Yep.
So, the clean resume lets the content
speak. The noisy resume
forces the reader
to decode the layout first.
So again, design
should disappear
and content
should stand out. So the proof is in the
pudding as they say.
So
here are the rules.
edit in Word or Google Docs. I prefer
Google Docs because it makes editing
much easier. Unless of course you are a
Word layout expert.
Very, very few people are.
If you are not a Microsoft Word expert,
do not craft your resume in Microsoft
Word. It's going to look terrible.
micro uh Google Docs
that's personally when I am revising
résumés
for my clients
that is what I use
um you submit you always submit a resume
in PDF form unless a posting requests
word that is because word can be altered
very very easily. You have to jump
through a couple of hoops to alter a PDF
and never submit screenshots or Canva
links. God, please don't do that.
Yes, Cam. Canva is
a design platform that has come out but
is a design platform in
in a lot of worlds that is deemed very
amateur.
So, don't do that.
I wouldn't even mention that you use
Canva ever.
If you do, keep it to yourself.
Um,
PDF PDFs pref preserve formatting.
Word and Google Docs do allow editing,
but again, you really, if you're using
Microsoft Teams, you really or Microsoft
Word, you need to know what you're
doing.
And clear file names
look professional and organized. I think
I forgot to name that name your file
clearly.
I I don't
and no like
you know JP resume for Jonathan Palner.
No, because then I mean a lot of people
are named JP, right? First name
underscore last name underscore
resumeé.pdf
PDF.
Okay.
So, some systems
in uh some applicant tracking systems
reparse PDFs.
So, clean formatting ensures your
content survives the upload.
Right? So, if you've been sitting
submitting your resume in a Word doc,
chances are it hasn't uploaded all of
the content
and maybe that's why you were declined
just because of a resume formatting
issue. That would be a sad sad day.
Questions
because we're going to be moving to a
live activity.
anyone?
>> Uh, I have a little something here and
whatnot. It's just that um a little
earlier today I uh put one like the
current resume
>> into a u website that is supposed to be
a resume builder/optimizer thing
>> and I don't know as good as some of
those sites are the particular one I I
was using looked a little suspect to me.
>> Yeah. because
um sure the score was low and I went to
improve it using their own tools or what
tools that were available
>> uh for free and I messed with it when I
did what they recommended and it still
came out to a little a low score
but then I noticed oh yeah there's a
bunch of extra stuff that are on the
premium track
and also a lot of stuff that are on the
premium track uh took away a lot of
stuff from the original resume.
>> Yeah.
>> Like you can only have a certain amount
of experience like um what's it called?
Like projects on your resume unless you
pay premium.
>> Yeah. Yeah.
>> So I'm like yeah just be careful out
there.
>> Yeah. Um,
as far as what recruiters feel about,
you know, resume builders,
um, the majority of them are only trying
to pull your information so that they
can solicit you.
>> Um, resume builders are,
it's better to tell your own story in
your own way. And I know that the
thought of revising and keeping uh
curating a resume is daunting,
>> but
>> yeah,
>> it's
I I wouldn't use a resume builder just
because you can also tell as a recruiter
those who have used ré builders because
>> like if somebody used AI because am
dashes and stuff.
>> Yeah. Uh, and it just really looks very
amateur-ish. And that is a buzzkill for
a recruiter. Like recruiters want to see
that you can tell your story in your way
because ultimately
>> we are going to have the initial what we
call recruiter screen with you. And we
are here not I and you know especially
for tech and yes listen
>> I know tech recruiters who are
insanely knowledgeable about tech.
>> They are few and far between.
>> They really are.
>> And they it really does depend on the
company that they're recruiting for. any
recruiter from Amazon, any tech
recruiter from Amazon, any tech
recruiter from Google, um most tech
recruiters from some of the snappy
startups, they know what they're talking
about and they're going to ask you
questions that the hiring managers want
them to sus out before you pass them
over to them. But the the recruiter
screen,
>> that's for casting,
right? That's about, and no one wants to
say this out loud. It's to see number
one, if you act like a serial killer or
crazy person,
>> how put together you are. Yes. What you
look like.
Honesty here.
Mhm.
>> How quote unquote seasoned you are,
meaning how many years of experience you
have,
>> and if they feel behaviorally,
because they will ask a few behavioral
questions, if you will fit in the group
that they're hiring for.
Okay.
>> Yeah. So, they're assessing the soft
skills for the most part. Yes, he's, you
know, yes, uh, we um, we met with Leo
today. He was great, even tempered, but
confident,
spoke very thoughtfully and
intentionally about his background. He
was confident in what he said. He knew
he knows who he is and what he can
deliver. That's what that recruiter
screen is about. It's about confirming
that everything that is listed in the
resume is true from a behavioral
standpoint.
Uh they will absolutely
um you know make sure that you um
can talk through those skills so that
you know when you move over to the
hiring manager interview that you have
the platform database whatever program
knowledge that is required for the
position but It's the hiring manager
that's actually going to a ask you
specifically
what you've done,
what metrics were used to measure its
success in if any because sometimes
you're coming from an internship where
you were only there for a few months and
you couldn't really see the results
delivered in metrics.
>> Yeah.
>> Um but that's that's okay. Again, you're
going to have your opportunity to talk
through that with a hiring manager. So,
that's the beauty. And that again, I
keep saying this, this is why
Dr. Emily
um
uh designed the program as it is to make
sure that all of you
um um and they really really want to
make sure that um you know she wanted to
make sure that you were able to step
into a role having had experience
working with real clients in real time.
So that's the beauty of this program
that that Dr. Emily designed. She's
really helped prepare you for that
conversation.
Um, now we're let's apply some of this
in real time to your resume. Okay. Now,
open your resume
if you can on your screen. If anyone is
driving, don't don't do that.
Um,
and do a quick check, right?
Do you have more than one font in your
resume?
Any uneven spacing between sections?
Crowded margins,
inconsistent bullet indentation.
All right.
And you know I am also happy to pull up
my resume.
Um
uh anyone would it be helpful for me to
pull up my resume? It it believe it or
not it does it does need some editing.
So, if you want me to pull up the the
resume, let me know and we can kind of
look at it because I can show you how I
format. And I only say not to use Word
because my husband is a designer
and he's an amazing designer
and
he is a Word expert. He designs and he
receives a lot of RFPs and he has to go
through all of it and design everything
based on an RFP and he deals with
Microsoft Word and I know it's like what
Microsoft Word that's for you know
that's an administrative tool if you
don't know what you're doing like if you
don't know that you should show the
paragraphs and the periods and the
spaces the period the dots between the
faces. If you don't know how to do that,
you shouldn't be using Microsoft Word.
Okay,
now let me pull my resume up because I
think nobody's saying anything and I
think it would be helpful. So, give me a
sec.
And I edit again all my resume résumés
in uh in my Google Drive. Let me just
find my resume.
I try.
All right.
So, I'm going to show you a couple
résumés. I'm going to show you a resume
that is an older resume that I was using
that
was no bueno.
And then I'll show you the resume that I
am using now.
All right. Where's my share screen? Here
we go.
Okay. Here.
Okay. Can everyone see my screen?
Yeah. All right. So, here's my resume
that I was using for a while.
everything you're not supposed to do.
I was using this resume more so in 2023,
2024,
but again, no good,
right? No good. Underlined three
columns, no good. Three columns of
bullets, no good lines, color.
Um
uh more color.
Um this is not
um yeah, it's not that it's not a good
resume. It's just a resume that is not
going it isn't ATS
compliant.
Right.
Um
here. Let's go back
there.
This Oh. Oh, this is my executive
assistant one. No, I don't want to use
this one. This isn't the one.
Ah, here we go.
So, here is what I've been using. Um,
and it does need some updating. Why do I
want to update this?
I want to take out the line
and I want to redo these core
competencies.
I want to reduce the columns and I was
using
three columns because I wanted to reduce
the size of my resume.
But again, I'm going to take out the
lines. But other than that,
I think it's pretty good. Um, but
definitely needs some updating for sure.
Um, now what I was talking about in
terms of editing,
now when you're editing
your resume,
you should be doing it in a view that
shows non-printing
characters.
You want to see that?
Absolutely 100%. Because it shows you,
look, I'm already seeing some issues
here. Two spaces, two spaces, two
spaces,
three spaces.
I'm also
seeing that
this is dumb. You don't want to do this.
I want to do this.
Take out the hyperlink.
I want to cut this.
I want to put the hyperlink back in
and put
email.
And I also
want to take out the underline
and take out
the blue and make it black.
Where my hyperlink go hyperlink it?
Huh? I wonder wonder if you can't take
out
Huh. What happened?
Let me see something.
Didn't do it. Hold on a second.
I wonder what happened there.
There we go. I guess it has to be blue.
Jonathan,
I think that's okay.
We'll see.
>> Yeah.
>> Now, we'll do the same for LinkedIn.
body can tell that it's active. And then
also if you mouse over it, the address
should pop up.
>> Yes. No, I know. But we're talking about
um design layout tonight and the
guidance is to not have any other colors
except for black on your resume because
it is not ATS compliant and it will not
be picked up by applicant tracking
systems.
Um,
>> I have to go into options, but I'm not
sure about the cloud. I know in word
there's options for that.
>> Yeah. Um, unless you are an expert in
Microsoft Word, I would recommend not
using it
because it is if you're not an expert,
you're not going to the edits are going
to look sloppy.
Um, so again, I'm going to
copy this.
I'm going to edit the link.
That makes it better.
LinkedIn
apply.
Now,
one might think, well, if you just put
email or LinkedIn, then the applicant
tracking systems aren't going to be able
to see that. It will because that's all
information that you add in a different
um part of your application anyway.
But these are
like it's it's pretty important for you
to see
the spaces
that you've added,
the par the the paragraphs or the line
spacing that you've added.
So this is how you create
a proper
um document.
Okay. So again, pull up your resumes
and check for more than one font,
uneven spacing between sections,
crowded margins,
and inconsistent bullet
indentation.
and
increase line spaces
to 1.1 or 1.2.
That is another reason why I absolutely
love
um go my my Google doc
because
say I want to
shift this spacing in my summary.
Highlight it.
I go to format
line spacing and paragraph
single spacing and then I can custom
space
line spacing always at single when
you're reformatting a resume so that you
can
custom use the custom spacing.
For this I used three and three. So
that's another reason it's just so easy
to use.
>> It's a old feature in Microsoft. They
just leverage off of Microsoft stuff.
>> Yeah, it is easier than Microsoft.
Um create uh sorry add one blank line
between sections.
and align all bullets and dates.
And it's easy to do that as well in in
here
and go here
and then you could
move it around.
and remove icon icons or graphics.
Again, it is a distraction for applicant
tracking systems.
And now,
who's going to volunteer
to show their their resume?
I could probably kill two birds with one
stone because I've got a question about
removing those lines.
>> What line?
>> Uh the ones I got in my like the lines
between sections. I'm not sure how to
remove those.
>> Okay. Are you What are you using?
Microsoft Word or I mean you really
would just highlight it and delete.
>> It's not letting me highlight it. It's
skipping from the word above it to the
words below it. So
>> um All right. Can you can you share your
screen?
>> Yeah,
>> it's a it's a Google doc.
>> I just sh saved it over there since cuz
you were saying not to edit it in Word.
That's where I had it before.
>> Okay.
Cool.
All right.
>> So, take out these lines that you're
talking about here.
>> Yeah. you know, um
maybe go to put your cursor at the
beginning of software developer
underneath right underneath summary.
Now, right in right in front of the S.
Yep. Now, backspace.
Yep. Yeah, you can do it in that that
space that you have the cursor. Can you
backspace there?
>> Huh?
That's weird. Um, can you go to format
and go to
Wait, hold on.
Hold on. No, sorry. Go to view
and go to show non-printing characters.
All right.
Um,
it might be because you
and uh backspace again.
There you go. Enter.
>> There you go.
>> Yep.
>> Down below languages. So, do that for
each one, I guess.
>> Yeah.
Yep.
And now it's going to change the line
spacing, but that's okay because we're
going to we're going to fix that. Okay.
right
now. Yep, there you go.
It's gonna keep moving down and it's
gonna kind of mess up your formatting,
but it's okay. We'll redo it. You don't
have to don't Yeah, don't don't worry
about that. Now,
>> awesome.
>> Also had a question, too. You're talking
about the uh the hot links.
Uh, should I leave should I leave.com on
the end of it or should it just like
>> like script?
>> Um,
sure. You can leave that.
>> Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, are those two things projects?
>> Yes.
>> Okay. I would leave them I mean, do you
have them listed down here somewhere?
>> Oh, yeah. They repeated it. Well, script
hammers here is template.
>> Okay.
>> And spoke to
>> and what's the other one?
>> The other one is that's your profile.
That's your portfolio.
>> Yeah, that's actually a good catch. But
I don't have spoke to work up here, but
I don't have turtle wolf down here.
>> Yeah. No, that's okay because that's
that is so the the the turtle wolf that
is your online portfolio, correct?
>> Yes.
>> Okay. So, what I would do is
do the hyperlink thing that I showed you
and just put portfolio.
>> Okay?
>> And then take out the other thing
because it's redundant. You have it in
two places.
All
right, cool.
>> All right. Why won't you go away now?
Try to highlight it.
>> The the line. Sorry. Line's driving me
nuts.
>> I'm trying to grab a hold of it.
>> Why
I need to know this?
Can you try highlighting it at the end?
>> Oh, there's that bit, too. Dang, it's a
stubborn line. I don't know what that's
about.
So, yeah. I mean, this is
>> It's almost like when I put it when I do
it on one, it wants to go down to the
next one.
>> It does. It's all right.
Yeah, we'll get it. Get it down. Oh,
okay.
>> Last one.
>> That one disappeared.
>> Just hit the delete key.
>> He can't capture it. If you
go to the end of that line,
>> that's as far as it lets me go.
>> All right. What about below it?
>> And doy below it.
>> Nope.
>> Yeah.
>> Not without putting just All I can do is
push it down by
>> Interesting.
Huh.
I am
stumped.
All right, we'll deal with that later.
But there's that.
>> Okay, there's that.
>> It looks weird, too, cuz it's got key
projects here that then they're all
listed on the second page.
But you said the formatting would if we
cleaned up the formatting, they'll
probably because I was trying to keep it
on one page anyways. Maybe if I just put
the extra line on the second page. I
don't know.
>> Uh No, we don't want that line there,
but we'll deal with that later. So, go
back up. And now again,
sections.
I think that the format of your header
with your name, what you do, your
headline,
your information. I think that's all
great. Beautiful. You've got your
summary.
Now the spacing I think for your summary
is perfect.
Now what we need to do is go to
technical skills. Now highlight
everything in languages.
Yep. Yep. Okay. Good. Go up to format.
Yep. Go down to
lines. Line and paragraph spacing.
Now go down to custom spacing.
Yep. All right. See how everything's
uneven there? Now, I would just make it
basic. Keep the single line spacing
always when you're maneuvering, when
you're doing the custom.
All right. Remove 12 and put six.
Remove five and put six.
apply. There you go.
I think that spacing looks nice.
>> Does it autosave or save it somewhere?
>> Um, I would say I think it's it
autosaves in in Google Docs. Yeah,
autosaves. But now, here's the thing
that I do. Maybe this is your template
email or resume. Maybe you
are someone who is customizing, doing a
little customization to your resumes.
You're tailoring some of your résumés to
specific job descriptions that you're
excited about.
What you can do is go to file,
make a copy
above. Yep. Make a copy
and it says copy of
and then you edit that
resume and you always have your template
on the ready. Does that make sense?
>> No.
>> Okay. So,
cancel
for now.
All right.
So
that's the that's the
that's editing. That's the type of
editing that I would recommend that you
do.
Um
now
align all your bullets and dates. Remove
icons and graphics.
you know,
I've gave like some pretty good direct
feedback.
>> Okay.
>> Um, now
your resume layout should never compete
with your content.
Your design, when design is clean,
recruiters stay focused on what you've
accomplished, right? And they're not
like dissecting your resume saying, "Why
on earth did they put this rectangle
with this pink circle over here, right?"
Um,
remove any visual clutter
and, you know, bring a polished version
of your resume to our next session. You
know, the goal isn't to impress with
style. You're not designers.
It's to make the reader stay longer on
your content and read who you are and
stay interested in that. Clean design
wins every time.
Okay.
So, we've got some time. What else?
You know, and you're likely going to
want to
Yep.
bullets seemed like they're being
they're clean now.
All right, you're using those arrows
now when you copy and paste this stuff.
Um,
so ah but wait, what happened to our
paragraphs?
Where did that go? Didn't stay. So we
got to I don't know what happened there.
view.
Go to view
and go to show non-printing characters.
Great.
All right. Let's see. Has everything.
All right.
All right. Cool.
Yeah, we want to see all that.
That's important.
That line really is bothering me though.
>> Yeah, me too. Not sure what to do about
it yet.
>> Me neither.
I'm going to have to ask an expert.
>> Well, there is help that might help. It
might not.
>> Where's the help?
>> Yeah, we could also ask chat GPT too.
That's what I would do. Maybe just ask
chat GPT on formatting.
>> I was thinking that too.
>> Yeah, my good friend Chat GBT for you.
Help you out there.
>> So who what other questions or concern?
Uh Tar, this is like one of your first
sessions. Uh any thoughts?
Um, I get all this and then I guess I'm
going to have to switch my uh switch
out. But you you mentioned in the
beginning what were some of the other um
I guess other apps or places we can go
to start writing the resume on.
Um
I I mean I write I don't
>> you know
>> is there any templates or anything that
>> No, I I wouldn't use any of those sites.
I think they're No, I I don't and and
the guidance is is from recruiters and a
lot of just
>> and it has become from my direct
experience those uh resume building apps
and websites are only to a make money to
force you to upgrade to some sort of
premium service that delivers the
mediocrity and it really is just trying
to get your information.
>> Gotcha. So, pretty much just take what I
have now, uh, copy paste into a Google
doc and go from there.
>> Yeah, I would. I would. And you know,
um,
make sure because again, you um, it
would be great if you could go back and
look at some of the recordings, but if
you're noticing like, um, uh, hey, John,
uh, scroll up to the top
for a second. Great. Notice the format,
right? He's got his name and then his
headline underneath. Right
>> now he's putting where he his location.
Some people will do that, some people
won't. Don't put your exact address.
Don't do that.
>> Okay.
>> Um that is another way for people to
steal your identity. The less
information is possible.
>> Um you know, showing your location is
fine. You can either even put remote or
hybrid or what have you.
>> Um then you have your summary.
Right. Then your technical skills. It's
really important that you list your
technical skills underneath your summary
because applicant tracking systems want
to see that first
>> and then your professional experience.
>> Then you can put in your key projects.
>> Okay.
>> Thank you, John.
You're doing great. Very consistent.
And then
>> I sent over I sent over two resumes to
you on this. So
>> okay,
>> if you want to take a look at those and
then you know tell me what you think and
then uh yeah I'll
>> for our next meeting I'll make sure I
get this into a Google doc
>> and make make the corrections.
>> Yeah. And now as you can see you've got
if you've got key projects to highlight
highlight them with a brief description
and we talked a lot about that as well
in some of these
>> sessions. and then adding your education
and certification.
>> Okay.
>> All right.
>> Yep. I think all of which I do have and
it's similar format to what uh
>> nice
>> Jonathan has.
>> Excellent. Excellent. All right. Cool.
Um
ladies, gentlemen, we've got one more
minute.
>> I have a question.
>> What have you got? Yes. about
certification like um
>> um what if you have a certification for
training that you did few years ago and
you never used it?
>> Um it does it pertain to and add to the
current experience that you're gaining
and the positions that you're targeting.
>> Yes.
>> Yeah. List it. It's within three it's
it's like the past three years. That's
relevant. Sure. Yep.
>> Yeah.
>> I'm picking up a Still Did I lose my
audio? You still hear me?
>> What's What's that?
>> I was I'm starting a class uh at the end
of the month. It'll be six weeks long
and it it's a Compa certification.
>> Oh, nice.
>> I was kind of cur I almost feel bad
putting it on there because it's only
six weeks. Is that But it is Compa
certified.
put it on if it is if it is relevant to
what you've been studying for the past
couple of years and if it is relevant to
the types of roles that you're targeting
now list it.
>> So they're not really going to question
it. It's only a six week course that
feels like it's not long enough to
really learn something.
>> Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter at all.
That's like a condensed session. Doesn't
matter how long it is.
>> Yeah. Okay.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. It's through one of the local
community colleges, but it's like 15
hours a week online.
>> Nice.
>> Yeah,
>> it's basically data analytics. Looks
like it'll mostly be Python anyways.
>> Okay. All right.
>> So, yeah, that'll that'll give me
something else to put down here at the
bottom.
Maybe we can learn how to get rid of
that line, right? All right, everyone.
Thank you so so much for your time and
uh we will see you next Wednesday with
another another fun session.
>> Appreciate you.
>> Thank you.
>> Bye.
>> Bye.
>> Bye.
