Hey, Leo. We'll just wait a couple
minutes for others to join.
>> All right.
on it. Then put in the trifecta. It ran
through.
Okay, everyone,
let's get started.
Welcome. Welcome.
All right. So,
welcome back.
>> Thank you.
>> Tonight, we are going to make your
resumes more concrete
and convincing by adding
numbers.
So,
we've been talking about this quite a
bit. Recruiters scan resumes.
Their eyes go straight to metrics.
Numbers make your work feel real.
Incredible.
Now,
you do not need a corporate dashboard or
a performance report to use numbers.
Okay? You can use counts,
frequency, time saved,
user impact,
or even estimates.
as long as you stay honest.
>> Okay.
>> So,
have you added numbers to your resume
yet?
>> Yes. No. A little. Anyone?
>> No. I just added dates.
>> Okay. Okay.
No, I haven't added them.
Wherever you are, you'll leave tonight
with three measurable bullets. So,
why recruiter scan for metrics? So, when
recruiters read your resume, they want
two things fast. What you did and how
much it mattered. I think we've talked
about this before.
Numbers give a quick picture of impact.
adjectives,
they don't give impact necessarily. They
kind of beat it around the bush.
So,
compare a few of these, right?
Reasonable.
Oh, compare these two.
responsible
for testing features
or
tested three features
per sprint
and logged bugs before release.
Sounds a little bit different. Yeah.
>> Yeah.
>> So, the second version feels more real.
It gives scope and rhythm.
Here's another.
Helped customers with questions.
Here's another. Supported 20 to 30
customer requests each week by email and
chat. Simple.
Very simple.
Again, same kind of work, completely
different impact.
So,
here's the thing.
Recruiters scan for metrics because
numbers show scale,
numbers show consistency,
and numbers hint at trust and
responsibility.
Your job is to tell the truth and make
the scale visible.
So
now
for the next few minutes we're going to
talk about what you can measure
even in non numeric roles. Okay.
So many of you feel stuck because you
think I do not have sales numbers or my
projects are in school or in a boot
camp, right? You still have options. You
can measure frequency,
right? How often
did you do something?
You can measure volume.
how many items, how many users, how many
tickets, how many pages or features.
You can measure time,
how long something took or how much time
you helped save.
You can measure scope,
size of the project or team.
You can measure reach,
the number of people who used what you
built or supported.
I'm going to put that in the chat
because I think that's pretty impactful
and informative.
Right.
So,
here are some tailored examples
um that I believe are perfect for coders
and tech students like you. So, here are
some frequency
examples.
Joined daily standups and completed two
to three tickets per sprint.
ran manual test passes on each release
before deployment.
I'll put that in the chat as well.
Okay.
Volume
examples
built six reusable React components for
shared layouts.
wrote 20 plus unit tests to cover core
functions.
Supported 50 plus customer orders per
week in a part-time retail role.
Okay.
Volume
examples. Let me get that in the chat.
time
examples
reduced form submission time by
simplifying fields and validation logic.
Responded to customer emails within 24
hours consistently.
Those are scope examples.
Reach
examples. Build a dashboard used by
classmates and instructure instructors
to track project progress.
created a tutorial that classmates
referenced during a group project.
Okay,
we'll get that in the chat and I believe
that's the last. So, if you can count
it,
you can probably use it as a metric.
You do not need to impress anyone. You
need to be specific.
Okay.
So,
how do you estimate numbers
honestly?
So, sometimes you do not have exact
numbers. That's normal. You can still
estimate.
Here is how to estimate in a way that
shows honesty.
So, think about
a normal week or a normal sprint.
Ask yourself, how many tickets,
customers,
pages,
or tasks do I usually handle?
Think about some of the projects that
you've done in TechJoy. You know, Dr.
Emily developed this program in a way
that you're working on real projects
with real clients. Okay?
So, you must have
something that you can measure through
those projects.
Again, how many tickets, customers,
pages, or tasks do I usually handle?
Pick a range that feels realistic.
Use language that signals an estimate.
What language
about
around
roughly
X to Y.
So some examples
supported roughly
15 to 20 customer requests per week.
reviewed
two to three pull requests per sprint,
tested around
five key user flows per release.
Okay,
so this kind of phrasing is common and
it's reasonable.
It gives the recruiter a sense of scale
without pretending you tracked every
single instance. Right? The rule is
simple.
Do not guess wildly.
Think through your typical workload
and choose a grounded range.
So,
let's do an activity. Okay.
Now, let's make this real.
I would like you to create
three metrics from your past work or
projects.
Can be current projects that you're
working on.
then
we will turn those into full bullets.
Okay.
So, here's step one. Let's brainstorm
metrics.
Okay.
So, I'm going to put this in the chat.
Okay. Here's your little assignment. And
I have a few other things to to paste in
there.
Okay. Take three minutes and write down
three raw metrics from your experience.
These aren't the bullets.
You're just
throwing some raw metrics on a piece of
paper,
right?
about how many features, pages
or components have you built?
About how many users,
tickets
or customers have you supported?
Could be even your own colleagues.
And then lastly,
about how many projects, sprints,
or group assignments have you completed?
Put that in the chat.
Okay?
Do not overthink. Write quick, honest
guesses.
She wants to go outside.
>> I'm getting
a minute.
One more minute.
All
right.
Now,
now we
apply
our formula, right? We've been working
with our formulas. Now
take each metric that you wrote down
and wrap it in a sentence that shows
what you did and why it mattered.
So let me
add in the formula.
Okay.
Okay. Now,
here's what I'm going to do.
I am going to
run through some templates, okay, that
you can use. I'm going to put them in
the chat, but I'll also talk about them
as well. Right.
Action verb. Here's template number one.
Action verb. What you worked on for, how
many, how often? Two, result or purpose.
Okay. Template two.
Action verb number.
items, features, tickets in time frame
which
resulted in supported outcome.
Template three
action verb
task
handling
volume or frequency to support team
users or project.
Okay.
And
let me find some my list of action
verbs.
Okay. Um,
all right. So here, let's use some of
these.
Okay,
here's some action verbs we can use.
Okay.
So, let's
let's go through some examples just so
it can also give you some ideas. Okay.
Here's one built
six
reusable React components
that streamlined the layout across the
main pages
we have built in here. Yeah, there it
is.
Here's another one. handled 20 to 25
customer support tickets each week
through email and chat.
Do I have handled in here?
No. Got the next one though. Tested
three features per sprint and logged
bugs before release to reduce issues in
production.
Got another one.
Is it reviewed in here?
Reviewed two to three pull requests per
week in suggested changes to improve
code clarity.
maintained a product list of 200 plus
items in a shared spreadsheet for team
reference.
Now paste one of your new bullets in the
chat.
No one. Anyone?
Come on, friends. Don't be shy.
Even if you started one and you're in
the process and it's not finished, just
throw it up there. We're all We're all
colleagues here.
I think where I get stuck matters.
I can't find the chat. I'm gonna have to
sign off and sign back in because I'm I
can't get to the chat right now. I don't
know why.
>> Okie dokie.
>> So, let's see.
>> No one wants to share.
>> I'm working on it though.
>> Come on, Leo.
I technically have one. It's just it's
not as big as a number I thought it
would be.
>> But it doesn't have to be big. This and
also this is an exercise.
>> Yeah. Anyway, implemented eight Cypress
Cypress tests
>> from the sign and flow
>> to increase test coverage on a single
ticket. Yes,
brother. Yes.
>> I just took one the ones I already had
on my resume and put a number in it.
>> But you're clearly working on your
resume here.
>> Yes.
>> This is clear. This is exactly what
we're talking about here.
>> It
already in the format that you put
there. You just put a number in it.
>> If
Yeah, if you feel that it's a realistic
number and if you feel that
>> yeah I
>> you can quantify it.
>> Yeah,
>> completely 100%.
100%.
I'm sorry. Glasses are Looks like I
licked my glasses and I didn't
Okay.
Okay. Okay. Turtle,
>> I'm still stuck on why it matters part
at the end.
>> Well, what was the objective of script
hammer?
It's a template, so I don't have to redo
everything from scratch every time.
>> A template for what?
>> Pretty much any project I'll start. I
It's a React template, but it's got like
uh it's got story book. It's got a lot
of things built into it that I'd want
almost every time.
>> Okay.
>> It's got spec. I It's got all It's got
those 33 features built in so I don't
have to keep adding them from scratch
every time.
>> Okay, let's throw this in chat GBT. I
don't know why y'all aren't look aren't
using this.
>> So,
okay.
Um
All right. Hold on. Let me see.
Hold on.
Okay.
Oops.
Hold on.
Use this template.
And now tell me again
what this script hammer is.
>> It's a template so I don't have to do
everything from scratch. Uh it's got
React, uh Storybook,
Spec Kit. It's got a lot of
>> So you don't have to do what from
scratch?
Um
there there's a lot of ceremony when you
like start a new project. It's like
you've got to set up everything before I
can even start coding. There's a lot of
steps I nor
get started.
>> So I try to get all that out of the way.
Anything I feel like I repeat on every
project, I've tried to put it in there.
>> Okay.
If I'm starting a new project, I'm like,
I've done this on the last seven
projects. Then, you know, I keep
repeating it over and over. So, I've
tried to put it into a template for this
from the start.
>> All right.
>> I'm just not sure how to word that word
to
>> Okay. So, right, but turtle use chat
GPT.
So
it's you use do you use React and
Storybook
to is that what Scriptammer does? They
it uses
those programs.
>> Mhm.
>> Okay.
Okay.
Oh, beautiful. Here it is. And now I'm
not smart. I'm not a coder. I just put
all this in chat GBT. Okay. Here it is.
Boom.
Okay, that sounds good.
All right, so let me share my screen
real quick so you can see what I did and
how I put it
in chat GPT.
All right, can you see my page?
Okay,
>> this is what I this is what I did. Use
this template and I just took the first
template because it made sense.
Use this template action verb what you
worked on for how many how often to
result or purpose to rewrite this bullet
for a resume to make it more impactful
here. And I just copy and paste what you
put built over 33 features for script
hammer. Okay.
And then this is what it came up with
first. And I said, "Okay, so great. Now
add the programs used in Scriptammer,
React, and Storybook." And that's what
it came up with. There's your bullet.
>> Okay.
>> All right.
So,
the technology is there, people. It's
there. Utilize it. All right, David,
you've got some stuff. Let's talk about
it.
All right.
Well, we need the the why. It's
impactful.
>> Oh, yeah.
>> In this first one, it's all right.
helped an average of 12 to 12 to 16
people per day at a hardware store who
had questions. Great. But what was the
result now? Delivered to
>> the wrong advice. That was the
>> delivered about 12 customers per day at
to help our professional. Okay. All
right. That's closer.
>> Yeah.
>> All right.
Okay.
Uh for this first one completed two to
four four tickets per month. Is there
any program
uh programs uh that you used?
>> Yeah. Next.js and um WordPress
and JavaScript.
>> Okay.
and TypeScript.
>> Oh boy, hang on. NextJS.
So you said Next.js
>> JavaScript.
>> Yeah. JavaScript.
>> Uhhuh. What else?
>> And CSS.
>> CSS and
>> Yeah. And and Typescript,
which is kind of the same thing as
JavaScript. Really?
>> All right. Little different.
>> Yeah. Not much.
>> We'll just put it in there. Okay.
>> Okay.
All right.
Here you go.
>> Let's see.
You have to share your screen again.
>> Oh. Uh, yes I do, don't I? Sorry, guys.
>> You don't have to. But you
>> It's been a long day. Sorry.
Oh, wait. I put it in the chat.
>> Oh, you did. Okay, never mind.
>> Yeah.
completed two to four tickets per month
for TechJoy Academy clients using
Nex.js, JavaScript, CSS, and TypeScript
to improve site performance and support
a smoother user experience.
>> That sounds awesome.
>> There it is.
>> Yep.
>> Whoop. There it is.
>> Right. How is uh how is this feeling to
everyone? Is this making sense? Like do
you guys think that you can do this
on your own?
>> Yeah.
>> It's just I mean guys if I can do this
>> please anyone can do this.
>> Yeah.
>> All right. So
that's a great exercise
right now.
Here's
a few things to think about
when you're looking at your resume.
If you have something that says worked
on,
change that to built
>> Yeah. were implemented.
Name the tech stack. If you can
clarify
who benefited,
user, team, customer, instructor.
So, where to add your numbers now,
right? Think about your current resume
and ask yourself. I think Leo was kind
of this is he he was already mentally
the there. So well done Leo. So which
bullets can gain a number?
Which bullets can gain a frequency or
range?
Which bullets can gain a time or speed
element?
Pick two existing bullets from your
resume and rewrite them with one verb
from our list, one metric, range, or a
time reference.
Right?
This is what we're talking about.
So, let me give you a few minutes to do
that.
We're not going to share, but definitely
definitely
see where you can add
Sorry, friends.
>> Chelsea, did you get a lot of snow up
there?
>> Yeah,
>> we got
>> foot of snow yesterday.
>> Wow. I figured as much. We got almost
down here.
>> How many?
>> We got mostly rain where I am.
>> Where are you?
>> Uh, eastern Connecticut.
>> Gotcha. Yeah.
>> But yeah, it it snowed a little bit
yesterday. This morning when I got up.
>> Yeah.
>> All day yesterday. It was just rain.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. No good.
>> Yeah, we got a lot of snow.
>> Yeah. I saw Brmley got like a foot of
snow, too. Like the mountain went up on
Facebook and they show all the fresh
snow they got was wow.
>> Yeah, we got a good amount. It was
pretty.
>> Yeah, I can't wait for our first snow.
This winter supposed to be pretty pretty
good. I think I think for snow they
said.
>> Yeah. You know, it I I live in an
apartment complex that they plow, but we
have to, you know, there's a little bit
of digging that we have to do with my
our car my car, our cars. So,
>> Gotcha.
>> But it's done now. It's all good.
>> Yeah.
>> Till the next We've got
to We've got this month, January, and
February.
>> Yeah. March it kind of slows down, but
we've gotten uh dumped on in March, too.
And April.
>> Yeah.
>> We've had three feet of snow in April.
>> Wow.
>> And you live near Albany, right?
>> Yeah.
>> Okay.
>> Yeah. I grew up in in a place called
Skenctity.
>> Yeah, I know that.
>> Which is, you know, part of the the
Capitól District.
>> Yeah. I told you I dated a girl from
Mechanicville. Um,
>> so and then her her her brother lived in
Clifton Park, so I know the other pretty
well.
>> Yep. Yep. Yep.
>> Yep.
>> Yep.
>> Um, no. Weekly does not count as a
number.
Now,
I am so sorry that I'm yawning. Um, it's
been a long week and it's only
Wednesday.
Now,
here's how I'm going to close. So,
tonight you learned that numbers tell
your story faster than any adjective,
but I would like to say that using them
in combination is is impactful.
So recruiters scan for metrics because
metrics show scale and trust. You do not
need perfect data.
You need honest,
reasonable numbers that bring your work
to life.
Add uh so your homework, right?
Add at least one metric to every
experience section on your resume.
Aim for three to five strong quantified
bullets.
Update your LinkedIn experience
descriptions with the same numbers so
your story matches across platforms.
And finally, data sells competence.
Use numbers to make your results
undeniable.
Who has questions?
concerns, thoughts.
Come on.
No one, no one wants to
provide.
No one wants to provide any insight or
thoughts.
>> No, I just I it sounds really good
though. those examples you gave, it
makes the it makes the resume read much
better and it sounds sincere when you
say it too.
>> Um, yeah. And you know, again, it's not
about having these perfect numbers, you
know, it's really about
being honest with what you've done,
right?
>> Yeah.
Well, anyway, those are my thoughts.
That's my idea.
>> Those are your thoughts. Okay.
>> Who else has thoughts
>> on script hammer? I've got there's over
2,000 tests in there,
>> but I feel weird because AI wrote all
the tests.
>> So, it's not like I wrote the test
directly, but I mean they are used. They
they they
I use them that the tests were written
before any of the code was written and
so it actually quantifies if the code is
passing or not. So they are usable test.
>> Okay.
>> Are using a pretty much to write almost
everything now. I mean hardly hardly
ever write anything from scratch. It
just feels weird to say I wrote 2000
tests when
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah.
But you know, it's like I think you guys
are doing great.
Um, and you know, I see a lot of um
a lot of work being done and it shows
absolutely shows.
Leo, what say you? Anything?
Any thoughts?
If you don't have any thoughts, it's
okay.
anyone?
I mean, I'm really excited. Uh I think
that these are this is some really
impactful
um
things that even I need to look at my
resume, my LinkedIn profile to see what
I can quantify
to see how I can update things.
you know, everyone can add met some sort
of numbers and metrics to their their
resume and LinkedIn profile. And I would
say that with these bullets, if you are
listing experience
um and and sort of listing descriptions
underneath that experience in your
resume, definitely do that. I would I I
I don't I never say that your resume and
your LinkedIn profile should mirror each
other, but in the experience and if you
have bullets underneath your experience,
they that should mirror.
>> Yeah.
>> Does that make sense?
>> Yes.
Okay.
All right, I'll I'm going to give you
three minutes or two minutes back of
your lives. Um,
>> I will Yeah, I'll see you next week and
uh have a wonderful, wonderful,
wonderful evening.
>> All right. Thank you, Chelsea.
>> You're welcome.
>> Good night.
>> Good night.
