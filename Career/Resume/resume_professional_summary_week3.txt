https://youtu.be/Utec2BjFJrg

Hello, David. We'll just wait for a
couple of people to join.
>> Okay.
Hey there, Timothy. We'll be uh with you
in I'm going to give it one more minute
to see who else shows up and then we'll
start.
Okay.
Good evening, gentlemen. How are you
both?
>> Fantastic. It's a little cold out though
today.
>> Oh, yeah.
>> I took my dog for a walk and it was
freezing.
Yeah, it was really cold where I am,
too. I'm in upstate New York. We
actually got a little bit of a wintry
mix and snow yesterday,
>> so it's it's popping. It's
>> Are you near Albany, that area or No,
>> I am. I am in
>> I So, I dated a girl I I went to school
in Viky, New York. I dated a girl from
Mechanicville, if you know where that
is.
I can't hear you.
>> I can't hear you.
>> That's me. And it is the professional
summary.
>> I missed all everything you said except
for the last two words because you were
you were muted or something. Okay.
>> Give me one minute.
>> Sure.
can.
Okay. And we're back. That's better.
>> Something happened with my headphones.
Sorry.
>> Yeah. No, that's okay.
>> Oh, okay. So, now the professional
summary is the about section in your
LinkedIn profile. They should mirror
each other, but should not say the same
exact thing.
Now, we already built your resume
profile. Um, you know, the what we built
is who you are, what you do, and what
you want next.
Your resume summary needs to do the same
thing in
a lot of people say three to five lines,
three to five sentences.
I would venture to say that could be a
tad bit longer. Okay. It must also show
impact and give proof of who you are. No
fluff. Okay. So,
do you have a summary on your resume
right now, David? I know that you do.
And we're going to
>> use you as the example yet again.
uh this evening.
>> Did you finish my resume by the way?
>> Um I'm working on the formatting of
that. Um but um I have been I I I feel
like using it is going to using it in
these sessions as example is going to
help flush it out.
>> Okay. Now,
um,
you know, uh, Timothy, I know you said
that you're really just starting to
wrap your head around working on your
resume. Have you,
based on what we've been doing in the
sessions
over the past couple of weeks, has there
been, you know, any ideating in your
head about it? Have you started doing
anything? Chipping away at it. Where are
you at right now?
>> I I have no idea right at the moment,
honestly.
>> Oh, okay. No worries. No worries.
>> No, it's just it's just
it worked today. Um, I got a document in
a mail in the mail and I'm reading
through it and it's another one of our
change control documents and I'm reading
through it and
>> it's like um, oh, this is slated to
close at the end of 2027
and I'm like, what? Wait, what? No, they
they they they said
beginning of 27 now that we're going to
close. Now you're saying the
I don't know what the story is anymore.
I really, really don't.
>> Well, that's okay. I mean, you're
>> No, it isn't. I had plans.
>> I hear you. This lack of communication
and this lack of
>> not lighting a fire under a bunch of
kesters is
>> the these are supposed to be
professionals
and they're acting
>> worse than the baddest 5-year-old I've
ever had to deal with.
>> Yeah, that's how I thought advertising
was.
So, I I understand where you're at when
I say that's okay. I mean, well, you are
here
just being present and being here and
listening, having access to to Dr.
Emily's program,
>> you know, it at least is, you know,
something that you can sink your mind
and your teeth into.
>> Yeah. I I I I I take my notes and stuff
and when I get around to there because I
I was honestly just talking to my
manager today about the same thing and
he's like
>> I he's like I don't know if I should
work on mine. What what you know and and
you're not the first person to say this
to me and it's like well yeah
>> and and what what what are your bosses
saying? Uh well,
>> yeah, I think that we're going to have a
lot of up in the air
>> things
>> for the next Yeah, it it's I think, you
know, just
keep doing what you're doing. You know,
>> that's that's all that I can do right at
the moment because
>> Yeah. Yeah.
>> That is so financially irresponsible to
walk away from that much money.
>> Sure. Sure. Then it you stay, you wait
it out, you prepare,
>> you save
>> and you plan
your your next life.
>> It's not even that. It's I do what I am
doing right now, which is at home in the
spare time that I have. I put in what I
need to for the the internship.
>> Yeah. And then the rest of the time I'll
work on one of my ideas. And if I can
get one of my ideas done and out there,
>> well, who's to say that I that you know
that by some miracle that becomes
more than what I'm waiting for? In which
case, it's just
>> Yeah.
>> I don't I don't need you anymore.
>> There you go. There you go. So, we're
going to we're going to manifest that
for you. But this evening, by the end of
this hour, you will have a
strong resume draft that matches your
LinkedIn story and speak speaks to the
current job market, right? So,
>> you know what a professional summary is
and is not.
First,
let's fix a common m misconception.
A summary is not an objective statement
like to obtain a role where I can grow.
>> Yeah. Yes. It is not a generic list of
soft skills.
It is not
a paragraph packed with bud buzzwords
with no proof.
Right? A professional summary is
a short focused snapshot of your value
and it is aligned
to a specific role
or role family.
It is
written in language
that recruiters use in job descriptions.
A professional summary is
backed by real work, projects
or skills.
In today's market, a recruiter
might review hundreds of résumés for one
role. If your summary sounds generic,
they move on.
If your summary sounds targeted and
confident,
they keep reading,
then
connect on LinkedIn.
So everything here has a lineup with
your LinkedIn about section.
If your summary says one thing and your
LinkedIn says something completely
different,
that's going to hurt the trust. We want
clear, consistent stories
across both. Okay, does that make sense?
>> Yes.
>> Great.
>> For sure.
>> So,
here is a simple structure that you can
use every time.
So,
Anna,
great. Anna's here.
Hey Anna, how are you?
>> Hello.
>> See that?
>> Anna and the sunshine.
>> Yes.
>> H please. Thank you. Ah, so we're were
uh we're diving in here Anna and we were
talking we're really focusing
>> keeping the focus on the resume
obviously and we are talking about what
a professional summary is and what a
professional summary is not.
So I was just talking about how where
you were first fixing the common
misconception on what a summary is and
is not. So it is not
an objective statement like to obtain a
role where I can grow. It is not a
generic list of soft skills. It is not a
paragraph packed with buzz bud buzzwords
and no proof.
A professional summary
is
a short
focused snapshot of your value. It is
aligned to a specific role or role
family. It is written in language that
recruiters use in job descriptions
and it is backed by real work projects
or skills.
In today's market,
a recruiter might review hundreds of
resumes for one role.
If your summary sounds generic, they
move on. If your summary sounds targeted
and confident, they keep reading.
then it should connect with LinkedIn in
some way. There should be um uh some
cohesiveness.
Everything here has to line up with your
LinkedIn section. If your summary says
one thing and your LinkedIn says
something completely different, that
hurts the trust. We want one clear,
consistent story across both. Now again,
this does not mean that your
resume summary needs to be exactly the
same as your LinkedIn profile. It should
be different,
right? So, that's what we're going to
continue to talk about. So, here is a
simple structure
uh that you can use every time on your
resume.
Now we're going to work with what the
guidance is, which is three to five
sentences, no more. Okay. Now, line one,
who you are and your main focus.
Line two,
what you do well,
including tools or skills.
Line three,
proof of impact. or contribution
line four and or five.
What you want next and how you want to
add value.
Now let's plug this into some real
examples.
And I
first since I am working on David's
resume
and I had already let him know like hey
here's what you've got in your summary
but you might want to think about
designing something different creating
crafting something different for your
summary and come up with a couple of
options. I did that so David will go
over that as well.
Um,
and now
an example
of a junior full stack developer.
Line one,
full stack developer with training in
JavaScript, JavaScript, React, and
Node.js.
Line two
builds endtoend
features
connects APIs and writes clean textable
estable code.
Line three
delivered multiple boot camp and
personal projects using git rest APIs
and SQL.
Line four,
seeking
a software engineer role where I can
contribute
to real product features and grow within
a collaborative team.
That's one example.
Now,
here is an example of a career changer
into QA or
SD.
QA engineer transitioning from customer
support into test automation and quality
focus.
Line two
skilled in manual testing
SQL queries
and API testing with Postman.
Line three,
improved
defect reporting and collaboration
between support and dev teams
in previous roles.
Line four,
targeting QA and SD roles where quality
metrics and automated tests
support reliable
releases.
One more example for you. Data
or analytics focused.
Line one.
data analyst with experience in SQL
spreadsheets and data visualization.
Line two collects clean and collects
cleans and analyzes data sets to answer
concrete business questions. Line three,
built dashboards and reports that helped
stakeholders see trends and patterns
more clearly. And line four,
targeting
data roles where I can support decision-
making with clear anat analysis.
Each
summary states a clear target field.
Each one includes tools and skills.
Each one gives some kind of proof.
Proof can be projects,
boot camp work,
previous jobs,
or measurable improvements.
Okay.
questions, concerns.
>> Good.
>> Okay,
>> good.
>> I'm glad to find the video to um do the
replay on on on what you just went over.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Um
Yeah, I think it might be too long to
put in the chat. However,
um these are all great examples of what
you should be doing. So,
here, let's see.
Let me
see if I can actually do this. Let me
put this in the chat.
Here's a structure
for you to follow the sort of formula.
You can play around with this.
And again,
if you already have a summary that you
want to work on,
I would go to chat GPT.
Copy and paste what I just put in the
chat in there. say
here
is my resume summary. Copy and paste
that in. Then put using the
formula below
and just put the line one, line two,
line three, line four or five.
Copy and paste that in
using the formula below.
write
three to five options
of a compelling summary
for my resume.
Then you can come up with a couple of
options and play around with it. Okay?
And we'll do that live with with Dave's
uh summary in a moment.
Uh where was I? Where was I?
So
let's talk about summaries a little bit
longer, a little bit more. So a weak
example,
motivated developer looking for an
opportunity to grow and learn, hard
worker and team player who loves
technology.
What does it not say?
anyone.
>> It doesn't say what specifics that this
developer did.
>> So, tech stack, right?
>> Yeah.
>> They didn't put any tech stack in there.
>> Yeah.
>> What else?
>> Can you repeat it? Um, what is?
>> Yep.
>> Motivated developer looking for an
opportunity to grow and learn.
Hard worker and team player who loves
technology.
>> Buzzword.
>> It It's It's a sentence, but it says
nothing. It's fluff.
>> Yeah. Yeah. So there's no text in there
>> and it didn't say what your focus are.
>> There you go. That's right.
>> Tells me nothing about you.
>> Right.
>> We're all motivated.
>> Sure. Yep. So no tech stack.
There's no kind of role that this person
is looking for
and there's no proof that any work
happened.
>> Right? Recruiters see hundreds of
versions of this
and we ignore it.
Now
stronger version
frontend developer
with training in React, JavaScript and
responsive design.
Builds accessible mobile friendly
interfaces and collaborates closely with
designers.
completed multiple projects using REST
APIs and Git
targeting junior front-end roles where I
can ship features that improve user
experience.
>> I like that.
>> So,
>> well, they exactly know what you're
about. That's for sure.
>> Yeah. Yeah. 100%.
So,
let me
hold on a second. Let me move you down
here
and
all right.
Okay. Here is
my chat GBT.
Okay.
All right. So I am going to new chat.
Let me share my screen.
And I have that option here. I've got to
make this a little bit.
There we go. All right. So I'm going to
share my screen.
I'm going to do something like
All righty.
Put you here.
Yes.
Can you still see my screen?
>> Yes.
>> Yes.
>> Is it Dave's resume now?
>> Yeah.
>> Okay. So, I'm going to copy this his
summary.
And now you can see my chat GBT, right?
>> Yes.
>> Okay.
All right.
All right. So,
rewrite
the following
summary for a resume.
Here is the current summary.
Copy and paste it.
To rewrite this
resume
summary,
use the following
formula.
Give me a sec.
All right. Where's my summary? Where's
my
Now I can't find my formula? There it
is.
All right. Hold on.
Structure.
All right.
Okay.
provide
four to five
impactful
summary options
that will
draw
in the attention of
tech recruiters.
or their job openings.
All right. So again, let's take a look
at this again. Can and everyone can see
this. Yeah.
>> Yes.
>> Okay. Rewrite the following summary for
a resume. Here is the current summary.
>> You have to be very specific with Chat
GPT and with any of these AI platforms.
The more context you provide,
the better result you will you will get.
>> Yeah.
>> So, we have the summary here, which I
think is a great summary. WordPress

University of Connecticut coding boot
camp.
expertise. We've got it. Proven ability,
background,
and what you're doing. Right. Here's

to bring user focused development and
teamdriven results in a growing digital
organization. Yeah, I don't like that
one as much as the second one. But the
the thing I think is missing is they're
they're taking away my respiratory
therapy background where I worked with
teams in my my career. That that's I
think is important to put in to my
summary.
>> None of these are doing that.
>> All right. Excellent. Let's see what
we've got. Let's let's see what the
others
>> talk about.
and and and this is how we drill down,

talk about my my background in
healthcare,
>> right? We they probably won't. So,
>> yeah.
>> Well, let's put let's put that to the
side for just a moment. For right now,
what we're looking at is all of these
options, and we're going to narrow down
which option we like best.
>> Okay.
>> And now, do you still like the second
option the best?
>> Um,
I don't know. It's it's it's between two

>> So, between
two and four,
which one do you like the most? H. Well,

that. We're not we're we're putting the
healthcare piece to the side for a
moment.

>> hold on one second. Let me just read it
again.
I think I like four best.

looking to grow within a techdriven
company that values continuous learning
and scalable innovation.
>> I like that.
>> Yeah.
>> I don't know it's going to sell to a
recruiter, but I like it.
>> Okay.
I'm gonna copy
paste.
>> Nice.
>> There it is.
>> Anna, Timothy,
any thoughts?
Any opinions?
outside of the one I dumped in chat.
>> Unless you want a coding job in
healthcare, I don't think most
recruiters will care. Only that you can
work with a team.
>> True.
>> Um I think
>> Yeah. To me, that's why the AI is kind
of skipping over it because it's like if
you're going into tech,
>> just like I I'm transitioning from
chemistry
>> and it it does briefly touch upon it,
but I don't give it enough context or
meaning because
what does programming have to do with um
weigh out five grams of sample and QS to
volume?
They're they're not going to care.
They care. Can can can you work with a
team? Can you solve problems? Uh um can
can you think outside of the box to get
those problems that AI can't get?
>> That that's what they're looking for
really if you think about it.
>> Yeah.
>> Healthcare just shows that you
>> very good point
>> that that you kind of care about stuff.
Um that you can work with teams.
Um,
>> well that you're experience stuff like
that.
>> Yeah, I was going to say the very least
like what Tim is saying that's a good
point that you you don't need it but if
you wanted to do it it would be under
the category of transferable skills and
that would be like problems problem
solving
>> how that's also carried over and brought
to the table. But how would we do that?
I don't know if they would really care,
but
>> that's the only thing I can see.
>> Actually, actually, Anna, they probably
would because one of the things I've
been
>> Well, listen, if one of the things that
I've been talking to AI AI about and
learning is
>> at least in game development, there's
something called the GDD, which is a
game design document. There's other
things out there that tell you how to
build games, system design documents.
These are things that you're supposed to
be able to read and follow. So if you
can say, "Hey, I'm in the healthcare
industry and I I know how to follow
protocol. I know how to follow
procedure." Well, that says that I can
give you one of these documents and you
should be able to follow it easily
because you already have the skill of
how to read, retain, understand, and
question what's in there. Well, it
depends on the content of the document
because I worked with documents and it
didn't give you anything. It just said
what's there. It just described what it
was there and how and not how to
implement it. And that's been one of my
nitpickiness
and why everybody tell me I should be a
freaking BA.
I'm like, no, I want to be a BA, but I
am very picky about requirements.
But dep depending upon the document,
depending upon who's writing it, yada
yada yada, there may be more information
in there and you need to know how to
read that,
>> work within the company's um structure,
profile and everything in order to
develop what the customer wants. So
those are transferable skills.
>> 100%.
Well, that's what I thought it was
important that I put that my background
because I can work with the nursing
team. I can work with the techs. I can
work with the doctors. You know what I
mean? We all they're all different teams
I had to work with to make
>> Yeah.
>> You know, to work in healthcare,
>> you know,
>> but if you're still interested
in working within healthcare.
>> Oh, I don't care about that. I just
wanted them to know my background. Hey,
>> Kai. Okay.
Then you sure if you want and desire to
list it in your summary, you can. Do I
think it's necessary? No. Because
ultimately,
they'll know what your background is
because you're going to list it.
>> Yeah.
>> But again, it's really a it's up to you.
This is your resume. Okay.
>> And the beauty of it is that you can
provide various options.
You have various options and samples
that you can use.
>> Got it.
>> Right.
>> Yeah.
>> So,
moving moving on.
We're going to continue.
Thank you, David, for allowing me to
utilize
uh your resume in real time.
>> Oh, yeah. No problem.
>> Yeah. So,
drop in the chat, what is one thing?
Well, let's go over this again. So, here
is
the strong version
of a resume summary. Okay, let me put
this in the chat.
Oo, wait. Timothy put something in.

project coverage, targeting full stack
or game development positions where 30
years of team-based system validation
meets modern web development innovation.
I like it,
but I think
some things like I think there could be
some tweaking there,
>> Timothy,
>> it's it's just
>> but I think it's good. Yeah, it's it's
just it's just the initial run through
of the five and I think that's the one
that I kind of like the best.
>> Yeah.
>> Um it got a little carried away with I'm
the go-to person because I don't think
I'm quite there yet. But
>> we'll work on it.
>> The worthiness and him giving his um
secret mountain time,
>> you know, the 30 years.
How about those two areas?
>> Yeah. Yeah. I mean,
>> yeah. Well, it's a work in progress.
>> It is. It is a work in progress. I I
would, like I always say, no one needs
to know how long you've been doing
stuff.
Just that you can do it.
Unless you are right out of college.
That's when you start emphasizing, I've
got two years of experience. God, you
don't want to know what I heard today at
work.
>> Oh, sure I do.
>> Some
So, I I've been working with this this
one lady who switched over from
chemistry to regulatory.
>> Okay.
>> And she's writing all the regulatory
documents that go out, but she's got to
send some stuff out to this other
individual.
>> Okay.
>> Who's apparently significantly younger
than her.
>> Uhhuh. She told me that he called a
meeting with her her boss, his boss,
and somebody else because
he's so important and and she sent him a
document that had a minor typo in it.
And how dare you waste my time? And it's
just like, "Oh my god, he's a
millennial, right?" And she's like,
"Well, he's way younger than me." Oh my
god.
is just
>> it's that level of insanity sometimes
you got to deal with.
>> Yeah, it is. It's a new uh it is
definitely a new culture of work for
sure.
>> I don't think I like that culture. If if
you're tripped up in a document by a
minor typo,
>> I'm sorry. Back in my day, you were a
whiny crybaby dweeb. Get out of my
>> It could be just a personality thing,
too, with that, you know.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Because, you know, I don't
I've met and I've had the privilege of
working with folks of all sort of
h cultures, demographics,
um
>> mental instabilities.
>> Yes. Yes. Step into the world of
advertising and you will see it front
and center. And you don't know ego until
you've worked in advertising.
>> I don't know for 25 years.
>> There's some big egos there that don't
know nothing.
>> Well, you know what? I feel like in
chemistry
um and in other
modalities
at least you have some impressive
pedigrees and impressive back uh degrees
to back up your ego.
Advertising not so much.
>> Yeah. But you know
>> it's just about what kind of cool
sneakers you're wearing.
>> Yeah. and how much you paid for them.
>> In my 30 years of experience, we've
we've come up with a new meaning for
PhD.
>> What is it?
>> Piled high and deep.
>> Oh yeah, I guess
>> cuz I I've seen four of them come
through
>> and
Oh my god. You You talk a lot but you
say nothing and you can't run an HLC.
>> Okay. whatever.
>> Well, you know what? At least they have
people like you that can show them the
right way to do things, right?
>> Ah, you see there in lies the problem is
I offer to and I was told do your job
>> and that wasn't my job.
>> Then they miss out, right? They miss
out.
>> That's the way it goes.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Now, what's I going to do
here? Okay. So here
uh what's happening? Why aren't you
doing what I want you to do? Okay, here
we go. All right. So here is
we went over this one. Now here is the
strong version of this
summary that we talked through. Okay.
Now, what is the one thing that the
strong version does
that the weak one does not? And now,
just to refresh your memory and for
those who joined later,
here's the weak example.
Okay.
Now again,
what is the one thing the strong version
does that the weak one does not do?
>> It specifies the um the languages that
you learn that you know.
>> Okay.
>> Okay. What else?
>> So David said it names the stack.
>> So we've got the tech stack in there.
Well,
>> very important
>> if if you look at the at the totality of
it um where he says where he talks about
accessible
and rest APIs and improve user
experience. He's clearly on that vein of
he wants to do something about user
experience and um
>> what um working with accessibility
features. Okay,
thank you. There, that's the that's the
first one I was looking for. Kai,
it names the role.
Clearly identifies the roles that this
person is looking for.
Boom. Straight away,
it names the stack.
It's all right there.
It gives proof
and
it explains the role clearly.
This positions this person as the expert
who can diagnose and fix weak content.
Okay. Now
what I want you all to consider
and think about and hopefully you'll
join me for tomorrow's session
writing your own summary.
You've got the formula
or the structure
and those who joined later,
the structure is all the way at the top
for you to use.
Okay.
Now,
step one, open your resume or your blank
document,
write some quick notes for each
some prompts, right? So, let's think of
some prompts.
Who are you in one short phrase? Who are
you?
Example,
full stack developer.
data analyst,
QA engineer.
What are your top three technical skills
or tools?
What are two real things you have built,
tested, or supported
projects count?
And what roles are you aiming at in the
next 6 to 12 months?
Okay.
I'm gonna copy and paste this.
Somebody wrote something. The
instruction message at the top is not
accessible to anyone that join. Ah,
thank you, Timothy.
All right, here's your step one.
Just
making sure. Okay.
Okay.
And as you write,
let me I'm going to put this in here,
too.
As you write, think about the jobs you
want to apply for.
Your summary should speak to those roles
directly
and and then
you start turning those notes into full
sentences
and throw them in chat GPT
and see what it gives you. Line one,
target role or identity
with experience in top tools or skills.
Line two, what you build, test or
analyze, and how you like to work. Line
three, the proof, one or two sentences
on projects, previous roles, or concrete
contributions.
Line four, your target. The kind of
roles or teams you are aiming for.
Okay.
Don't worry about perfection yet.
Doesn't have to be perfect.
So, you know, tighten your resume so a
recruiter can scan it in 5 seconds.
Remove repeated phrases like hard worker
and team player
unless you give proof.
remove filler like seeking an
opportunity where I can grow and learn.
Nobody cares. Everybody's doing that.
>> That's what everybody wants.
You keep the role, the stack, the
outcomes, the target.
My example to you of an example of
tightening a summary. Here's the before.
Full stack developer with training in
JavaScript, React, and Node.js.
Passionate about learning, growing, and
working with a team. Completed several
projects and enjoy writing clean code.
Okay,
here's the after.
Full stack developer with training in
JavaScript, React, and Node.js JS builds
full features from front end to API
integration with focus on clean testable
code.
Completed multiple projects using git
rest APIs and SQL
targeting engineer roles on
collaborative teams.
Simple.
So homework and preview for Wednesday
because we are at time. So homework,
finalize your three to five line
summary.
Make sure your target role is clear.
Add at least one concrete proof
statement.
copy a version of this summary onto your
LinkedIn about section or
save it to update
because you're going to be you can do
this for both that now you can actually
you've got a couple options Dave
>> you can actually throw one of the
summaries
into LinkedIn and then use one for your
resume
>> maybe I can show you my LinkedIn
summary tomorrow.
>> Yeah,
>> I redid it yesterday.
>> Okay. Excellent.
>> So, I actually redid my whole LinkedIn
profile.
>> Beautiful. Beautiful.
>> If you want to use that, we can look at
>> Absolutely. I'd love to.
>> Okay.
>> Now, tomorrow evening, we're going to
workshop real summaries live. We will
tailor summaries to real job
descriptions
and make sure your summary speaks to the
current job market.
So again, as I keep
trying to instill,
this is not a race,
you know, name,
headline,
LinkedIn profile,
GitHub link, phone number,
email,
summary,
and then just keep chipping away.
Cool.
>> Got it. Hey, Anna.
>> Yeah.
>> Um, I'm going to miss tomorrow's power
circle. I got to take my mom to the
doctor's in Harford.
>> Oh, okay.
>> So, just tell Key. I won't be there.
>> Okay.
>> All right. That's all. Sorry.
>> I will.
>> Okay.
>> All right, folks. Have a wonderful
evening and we'll see you tomorrow.
>> Okay. Have a good night. Bye, guys.
>> Thank you.
