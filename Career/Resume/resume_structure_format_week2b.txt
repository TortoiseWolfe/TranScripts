Career Strategy w/ Chelsea - Resume Series: Structure & Format (Week 2 Session B)
https://youtu.be/sYWh4NN-mKU

Hello sir. We'll just uh give a couple
more moments for people to join.
>> No problem. Sounds good.
Okay, David.
>> I am here whenever you're ready.
>> I'm I'm here too.
I think you are the solo
the solo man.
>> That's okay.
>> That's okay because we can work on your
resume. So that's just fine
[clears throat] with me.
>> Yeah.
>> Um because we're really, you know,
that's what this uh these sessions are
largely going to be.
um when we're talking about resume and
structure
>> um formatting things like that because I
think [clears throat] it's important to
do these exercises with
>> resumeumés in real time and we always
have people sort of trickling in. Here's
Leo. So, this is great. We'll review
some stuff from last night which I'm
sure you don't mind.
>> Hey Leo, how's it going?
Doing good. Oh, wait. Cameras.
[laughter]
>> Hello. How are you, sir?
>> All right. Love it. Love it.
>> Full stomach.
>> Oh, same. I'm ready to go. I'm like
ready for another eight hours of work.
>> Not really. I'll go to bed.
>> Not [clears throat] yet.
But anyway, um, so welcome to session B,
Leo. We covered a ton yesterday and I'm
going to go over a lot of it. Um, you
know, you will be very, very familiar
with what I went over because you were
one of the first people that I edited
your resume. Um, and I hope you liked
it. I wasn't sure if you did. I don't
know if you found it helpful, how much
you've been utilizing it, how much
you've sort of evolved it, but again,
what I was talking about last night with
some of the other students who showed
up, uh, David included, is that this is
an evolution. your resume is always
going to
um
experience facelifts throughout your
career because you know Leo when you are
5 years in as a full stack developer
somewhere at some like big company you
are going to be editing things down and
um deciding
what formats are going to be best for
you in the next iteration of your
career.
So
this week was really focused on
structure and format. Um and the focus
was really reverse chronological
versus
functional resume.
And we are also talking about on kind of
like the surface and in the background
of all of that design clarity beating
decoration,
right? Making the format nice and clean,
nice and readable, easy on the eyes.
That's super important not only for ATS
systems but for recruiters who as we
talked uh last week uh scan resumeumés
in six to 10 seconds
and they also look for that clarity that
structure alignment with the role and
then the format should guide their eyes
not overwhelm them and the same as for
anyone who looks at your resume
including yourself. So, you know, we
spent so many weeks covering LinkedIn
strategy strategy and the importance of
positioning yourself uh for that
visibility and and I know Leo, every
week you're diligently doing that,
making yourself more visible. I read
your comments on the check-in. I know
that you are actively reaching out to
folks,
being strategic in applying and then
reaching out to those folks at those
companies that you're applying. So, well
done. I am noticing I am calling it out.
Excellent work. Um, and you know, we're
shifting now into that the major tool
which is your resume. So if LinkedIn is
your storefront, how you advertise and
market who you are, your resume is that
like original document that somewhat
mirrors what LinkedIn is saying, but
it's also
that that contract like that tangible
document that is proof of who you are
and what you do and structure focus
Focusing on the structure and format is
important because
you know if a recruiter can't navigate
through your resume,
they won't
they won't do it.
>> [clears throat]
>> So, um,
what
we what we really drilled down on last
night and and what I've likely never
explained to you when I was editing your
resume or right before when we had our
one-on-one was there are two core
structures for resumeé formats.
most common and preferred um for
consistent career paths is a reverse
chronological resume. So Leo, I imagine
that if you were if this is how you
um try to gain entry into a new band,
right?
If you used a resume,
you would likely use the reverse
uh
you would use the reverse chronological
structure of the resume. Hey an
um and the reason why I'm saying that is
the reverse chronological
resume structure.
It's most common and preferred for folks
that
are looking for work in their chosen
career path. That has been the
consistent thread of what they've been
doing, right? So, you're a musician
>> and this is like what you that's your
passion. That's what you do.
If you were to apply
for a role in a band,
that's what you would use because that's
who you are. That's what you've been
doing. You're not shifting into that
position. That's that's like your ethos.
Now, a reverse chronological
resume
highlights
steady progression and recent
experience.
Now
[clears throat] Anna, I'm calling you
out because I think that this is really
going to be a very valuable session for
you and we'll also lead into our private
discussion tomorrow
that
so we're talking about résumés, right?
And we're talking about formats and
different structure of résumés. And what
I'm highlighting now is two core
structures, two different types of
résumés.
And now I think when I I thought that I
updated and edited your resume and I
think initially what I did was I used a
functional resume but I'm rethinking
this that maybe
a reverse chronological resume would
work well for you because you're not
really doing a crazy shift.
You're staying in QA,
but you're adding in
>> that development piece.
>> Actually,
>> actually, I want to get out of QA.
>> Okay. Okay.
>> Never mind. [laughter]
>> All right. Excellent. Now that we've got
that, now that we've got that straight.
So, I think all of the information is
going to be valuable. Right. So the
reverse chronological
resume is most common and preferred for
consistent career paths. So Anna, if you
were saying, "Yeah, you know what? I
still want to continue to be in QA."
Then I would say, "Hey, you know what?
Let's think about the reverse
chronological resume." It also
highlights steady progression and recent
experience. It's also very easy for both
recruiters and ATS uh systems to read
applicant tracking systems.
Now
what I've been utilizing
admittedly even for myself even though I
am not changing career paths I'm looking
for work as a recruiter.
I've been using a functional resume.
That's what I've been choosing to do.
>> I might [clears throat] rethink that,
but for now, I'm keeping it. Now,
functional résumés, as I've been
explaining,
are skills based.
Now, ideal for career changers or those
with mixed experience.
I so wish Michelle was here because she
I think would really benefit from this
because
she has a lighting design and production
background
and she's now incorporating development
into her skills.
So I think this would be really
interesting for her to listen to and be
a part of. Maybe she'll listen to the
recording.
Functional résumés are also great for
groups
that it it groups experience under skill
categories instead of dates.
It highlights transferable skills
and impact
instead of job title. So a lot of times
in functional résumés you'll see core
competencies
someone will list as well as skills
and then they'll talk about those core
competencies. They might list projects
that they've done and then at the bottom
they'll list that chronological
work that they have done that
experience.
Now,
last night I showed some examples of
that. Would that would that be helpful?
I mean, David saw it, but Leo, Anna,
would you like to see um uh my version,
my resume of a a reverse chronological
resume as well as the functional? Yeah.
Okay, let me pull this bad boy up.
Okay.
So, I could do it this way. Let's
Let's do this. Hopefully, this will work
the way I want it to.
All right.
And I know Zoom doesn't like personal
information, but I can't be bothered to
mark it off. So,
don't drunk call me. That's all I can
say. Um,
here
is my
chronological resume.
did this first.
Wonder. No, that's not in.
I wonder if I could. There we go.
A little bit more real estate here.
So, hopefully all of you can see this.
Can you see this? Okay.
>> Yeah.
>> All right. So, it talks about my
experience. There's not like a very
robust summary. And you know, I
I crafted this resume
several months ago and even longer
before that. So, I would change a lot
here. I'd probably not put this blue
square section. I wouldn't put 10 plus
years of progressive experience.
I I would keep this. And I would I did
put my area of expertise here. I added
in various parts of my resume
some of the LinkedIn recommendations
that I compiled. I thought that was a
nice touch.
And
there's no real like yes there is this
it's not quite a summary but it
highlights what I've done
now
professional experience and I've gone
through this all here right
and oops hold on here all right there we
And
I've again thrown in another referral
or recommendation.
Um,
more experience.
More experience.
Additional
experience.
and then
my education and certification. Okay.
Um
it's
really I think for career changers
I do believe that the functional resume
is going to be important.
Now,
here is
another resume of mine. This is one that
I actually crafted specifically for a
company that I was applying.
This is a functional resume and you can
really tell the difference here.
So here, name, headline, number, email
address, LinkedIn profile, and then
we're getting into the professional
summary.
I listed my core competencies.
I listed my selected
my selected achievements.
So
where
let's see let's pull this up again
where in this
I spoke about
those core competencies
underneath every role that I listed.
This one
I I segmented it out to really highlight
recruitment and candidate experience.
Here's what I've done. Strategic
sourcing and pipeline development.
Here's what I've done. Collaboration and
stakeholder partnerships. Here's what
I've done.
Diversity incl and inclusion and
recruitment. Here's what I've done. Then
I listed my professional experience. I
didn't list all of it. Earlier
experience available upon request. Then
education and certification.
This
shortens the resume as well. That other
resume was like three pages long. This
one's two actually. Yeah, like almost
like one and a half. But that's a really
good example of that,
right?
So let me stop
stop stop sharing.
So
thoughts
what is your feedback? What do you think
about both of those resumes? And what do
you think is best for you?
Maybe you're like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Thank you for this information.
And I understand that functional resumes
are for career changers, but I really
like the reverse chronological. That's
where I think I'm going to head. Cool.
What do you What do all What do you all
think?
>> I don't know. [laughter]
>> I don't really have any kind of
feedback.
>> Okay.
>> I really don't.
>> Okay.
All good. You don't have to know.
>> Whichever one capture,
you know, capture
what needs to be captured for me is
fine.
>> Okay. Leo, what do you think? Because I
think like I did your resume early on.
>> Yeah. Yeah. You did. You suggested me to
add a little res uh summary bit to it on
the very top. And now I see where you
got that from on the functional resume.
>> Yep. Yep. Yep.
I mean, your resume was great when you
handed it over. I just really did some
like shifting and font and adjusting and
and all of that stuff, but you know,
like where where do you guys sit with
this?
What do you think? I'm just I'm
interested. What do you think is best
for you?
>> Which one is good for transferable
skills?
>> Um I would say the functional resume.
>> Okay. And functional because I I want to
include
you know stuff that I'm doing in in the
academy but also transferable skills.
>> Yeah.
And I think that
yeah,
I think that that is what would work for
you, but personally myself, that's what
I think would be best for you. But I
also I also want to make sure
that you're kind of like digesting
and analyzing exactly what's going to be
best for you. I think
You're all asking the right questions.
But
um
so at the end of the day, Leo, what do
you think you're going to stick with?
>> I'm probably going to stick with the
functional resume that I currently have.
It's definitely doing well with
displaying the stuff that I'm learning
from this
>> uh TechJoy thing.
>> Yeah.
>> And yeah,
>> I feel like it really does a good job at
displaying those technical aspects of
it,
>> like being able to go each bullet point
from each ticket that I've done or at
least which ones I want to highlight, I
should say.
>> Okay. And Anna, you're just like, I'm
not sure. We'll talk about it tomorrow.
Yeah,
[laughter]
>> that's true.
>> All good. All good. All good. That's
cool. I can dig that.
>> I respect that. Um,
so
when you use each format
with the reverse chronological
structured resume, you're staying in the
same industry.
So maybe that answers our question,
Anna. Maybe it really is a functional
resume that we're going to be moving
over to for you.
>> Yeah,
because I I what I really want to do is
transferable skills that say that kind
of like shows, well, I've already worked
in tech, but now I'm coming to another
area of tech and this I want to focus on
and
>> how do I need help?
>> 100%. No, 100%. And you know what, Anna?
Don't minimize
who you are and the experience that you
have and what you're bringing because
everyone right now is reinventing
themselves.
And
this program that Dr. Emily has
developed is very special and it gives
you an incredible opportunity with
amazing
um mentors
and I think that
you're going to craft a future all of
you you're going to craft a future that
is really going to be fulfilling and
sustainable
and you're learning all over the right
things here.
So you when you are using the reverse
chronological structured resume you have
to you have consistent experience and
titles. So again if Anna was going to
stay in QA that's what I would recommend
and and and allows you to show and
showcase that steady growth.
Now,
with the functional resume,
you're pivoting careers.
Again, I think about Michelle.
Michelle, where are you? Um,
she's a lighting, she was a lighting
designer in and uh production, stage
production.
She's moving into development.
Maybe someone's a teacher. We've got
Timothy who was here yesterday. He's a
pharmaceutical chemist.
How wild is that? Moving into developing
functional resume,
right?
Functional resume is also
recommended if you have gaps or mixed
experience.
There are a couple of students ha that
who have taken time out
um to be a caretaker for a loved one.
Totally acceptable.
Totally acceptable to note that not only
on your resume but on LinkedIn. This is
life. Life is lifing.
And it's completely legitimate to list
where you've been and what you're doing.
Um,
now the thing with the functional
resume, and this is what I've been
correcting quite a bit in résumés, is
you need to highlight skills
before you highlight the timeline.
Skills are what's really important
there.
Yeah.
Now
what again
continue to think
which structure fits your career path.
If you're staying in the same PE field
the reverse chronological is where it's
at.
So if there was a student
who
has been similar to Anna doing more low
code
roles during their career, maybe they
were business analyst or data analyst,
but now they're moving more into
full stack development,
I would say.
I would venture to say reverse
chronological might work as well for
that. I I'm a little on the fence to
tell you the truth, Anna.
But if you're completely pivoting and
you're completely rebranding yourself,
functional resume. And you know what,
Anna? If you want to completely rebrand
yourself and get a full faceelift,
functional resume.
>> Okay.
>> Right.
So,
and I asked this last night.
>> Wow.
Um,
what's your biggest challenge
with your current resume format right
now? So, think about that for a minute.
Hey there, Bernard. I don't think I've
ever seen you before. So, welcome.
We're talking about resumeé structures
and formats and the difference between a
reverse chronological resume and a
functional resume.
Oh, and he's gone.
[laughter]
He's like, I don't want to talk about
that.
Um so let's take uh some time to talk
about resumeé anatomy
and the non-negotiables.
Okay. And this is really both for both
functional
and
uh reverse chronological
resumes.
So
the sections that must appear
name
header with LinkedIn and your contact
information.
Now if you are a developer and you have
a GitHub
definitely put that there.
If you are
someone who is a developer
and you've been working at a company for
a handful of years, I would say two to
five, and you've compiled some projects
that have been produced that you're
proud of, that you've received
permission to showcase on a portfolio
site.
I would also
add that link in there as well.
have to have a summary minimum of
[snorts] I would say
minimum of two sentence max five
guidance is two to three but I think you
can you can add a little bit more not a
story but
core skills or your technical stack has
to be there
experience
and or projects.
Then your education and certifications
keep your margins balanced and fonts
consistent.
And for the love of sweet baby Jesus, do
not put your headsh shot on your resume.
That is a European industry standard.
They also do it in Asia. Brazil, we
don't do it here. No need.
Um,
consistency with font and formatting is
really important. Line spacing.
It's all about being easy on the eyes.
something clean and polished.
Avoid designheavy templates that ATS
systems can't read.
That's one reason why I ended up editing
my first resume and like rewriting it
completely
because I just thought that I didn't
feel like I was receiving um a lot of
attention with my resume.
So, I moved to a functional resume
because I thought my other resume was a
little too designy, little
squished and decorative and
busy.
Stick to one page
unless you have several years of
experience. Now, that's the guidance.
Do I think you can have two pages? Sure.
Three pages is excessive. I think even
if you are a PhD
I think there are ways of talking about
what you do clearly and concisely.
Um
clarity
matters more than decoration.
Um, we did some building of
Dave David's resume last night. David,
do you mind if I share with Leo and Anna
some of the things that
>> No, not at all. Yeah, go for it.
>> Okay.
Okay. Let me get back to it.
I haven't worked on it today, David. I'm
so sorry. It was like a boom.
>> I'm disappointed. I'm just kidding.
[laughter]
>> Oh goodness.
>> I got to turn off this TV.
>> The volume down, but same old things
play over and over. It's like, look.
>> Yes. All right, guys. So, let me share.
>> Shut it down. [laughter] Yeah.
>> All right. Here we go.
All right. Can you all see this?
>> Yeah.
>> Okay. Now, this is what we started to
edit in real time.
>> Oh, that looks good.
We we did this, right?
So,
this
is kind of what we we we were seeing.
And listen, it's not terrible at all.
Actually, the complete opposite. I mean,
this is an excellently crafted resume.
Beautifully crafted.
>> I think that
>> was good.
>> I I think that it can go further. I
think there's definitely some more
tweaking that can be done,
but I did take away the consistent bold
Right.
>> Yeah.
>> Um
and
I will continue likely to do that. Um
reducing
me see what did we do here for font
eight? Really?
Uh summary technical skills. Yep. So
probably reduce this to eight.
And
I'm going to
correct line spacing
format.
Line spacing. Custom spacing.
Let's do
>> I think we did three yesterday, didn't
we?
>> Yeah, we did. But you can I play around
with the spacing a little bit.
>> Yeah.
>> All right.
Now, I also
>> I'll be right back, guys. Sorry about
that. Oh,
>> okay. No problem.
All right. So, we'll take away
the bold.
Take away.
This
maybe.
>> Oh, yeah. That's kind of cool.
No italics.
>> Okay,
look at that now.
Okay, I didn't see that before. Text
stack. I like it.
Oops.
there.
>> Okay.
>> Should we highlight text stacked or no?
>> Perhaps
>> I don't know.
>> Perhaps.
What's going on here with the lines
facing?
All right, there we go.
this. It's making me Oh, wait. Hold on.
Was this
Did that have a link, too?
>> No, it's because it's in development.
There's no There's no
>> Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
>> There was no deployment.
>> There we go.
Okay.
See? And it's just these little little
tweaks.
>> No.
>> No.
>> All right. We'll think what we want to
do with that text stack there. But I
just want to kind of keep that nice and
clean
>> for right now.
>> I may just underline. I don't know if
it'll look cool or not. We underlined
it.
>> Underlined what? with the word the words
tech stack.
>> Yeah, I'm trying to figure it out.
>> I don't know.
>> I don't know.
>> I don't know what I will want to do with
that.
>> Okay,
>> it might be
maybe we
make it stand out a little bit. Let's
put it like that right now
because you want it to
pop a little bit.
>> Yeah.
>> Okay. And now we've got experience.
So this is kind of the playing
that you do.
>> You want things to be consistent. Again,
>> if these head these sort of headlines
here are
uh size eight, you want the rest to be
that way,
>> right?
>> No. Hang on a second.
Yeah.
All right. I thought
Okay.
Thought that looked funny.
There we go.
That is driving me crazy.
See, so
it's a lot of this.
>> Yeah.
>> Grab a glass of wine if you drink and
you just let it rip.
There we go. Now, this is what I do and
it helps me see view.
Is it the equation toolbar?
No, that's not what I wanted.
And
no, I don't want that
there.
This helps me see
spacing.
>> Oh, yeah.
>> That helps me.
Oh, it's driving me nuts. All right. So,
see, so that's this is how we
All right.
All right. I see.
So, this is just sort of an example.
Where'd that go? [clears throat]
Right.
And then what I'm going to start with
immediately
is
getting all of this.
Yeah. Come on.
Go back to your line spacing. Make sure
it's always at single.
And then you do your customizing.
And I'll start at three. Sometimes I
mess around with it. Oh, look. He
eliminated nearly an entire page.
All right. And then
I should have actually
unbolded everything.
>> Babe, you're in business with this
resume. [laughter]
>> Yeah. Hopefully.
>> All right. I got to I got to change a
couple of things though, but I mean not
much really.
>> So, we're getting there.
>> Yeah,
>> we are getting there. Now, what I'm
probably going to do
because this is kind of a mix really of
uh in its current state a reverse
chronological resume,
right? because we could see.
>> So, what I'm going to do
is tweak it a little bit. But, I mean, I
think it's
>> pretty interesting right now. So,
there you have it. That's the example.
>> Nice.
>> Um, yeah. I think it looks good, David.
We're We're getting there. We're getting
there.
>> We're getting there.
>> I like it.
All right, good. We'll add. So,
>> uh, you know,
your format sets sets the stage for
everything else as you can see
and
rebuild. Take a look at your resumes
and you start rebuilding the base layout
using the guide that I've given you.
Anna, we'll work on this tomorrow
together.
Now,
a clear focused format
shows recruiters you respect their time
and it's the first sign you're ready to
be hired
>> to be honest. It really is. So,
we, you know, every resume needs
structure
before substance. And something that I
talked about last night and something
that my husband taught me because my
husband is a designer at a software
development company and he designs a lot
of presentations for you know managing
directors and seuite leaders.
When he lays out a presentation
he doesn't even put words in there.
He'll just put gibberish
like paragraphs of things that are just
letters. Like he'll just or he'll use
a poem or,
you know, something he read just to
populate the layout because he's really
just starting with the layout,
right? So get your header up there. your
name, contact, LinkedIn, GitHub,
your summary.
Your your summary is a short paragraph
tailored to goals, your core skills,
your tools, experience, andor projects,
education, certifications. Think of your
resume as prime real estate.
The top third must capture interest
instantly.
Um,
whit space
helps readability.
You know, you have to have a little, it
can't just be crammed in there. Job
titles and keywords drive recruiter
search results.
Look, take a look at the skills that you
put in to your LinkedIn profile.
Incorporate some of that in. List the
database and program knowledge that you
know, right?
What do you want a recruiter to see
first when they open your resume?
Prioritize alignment
with your job title.
If your resume can tell your story in
one clean glance, you've done your job.
>> You know, readability,
alignment, simplicity.
This is what we're looking for.
You know, we are starting to really
build a foundation here.
Next week
we are going to start filling it with
resultsdriven
content that gets attention.
A clean design gets you seen.
Strong content gets you hired.
>> My god.
>> Right.
So
this is
This is what we've done here this
evening. We've got
nine minutes.
I'm serious about something um
>> which is like a side topic and um that
is um when you put your resume out there
um I would think maybe not everybody but
that we may run into
companies that want people of a certain
demographic in terms of young.
>> Yeah.
And so
>> they all do.
>> So what do that mean for us mature
people?
>> It means that you do not list
any experience on your resume or
LinkedIn that is over 10 years old.
It means you do not list the year that
you graduated from college.
That's why I took mine off.
>> Yeah, my LinkedIn is still a mess.
[laughter]
>> Well, we can work on that tomorrow in
real time.
>> I heard I Sorry, I didn't interrupt. Um,
I heard that employers weren't hiring
Gen Z as much because they're kind of
lazy. That's what I hear. [laughter]
>> I mean, spoiling them. No, I know not
everybody, but I'm just saying.
>> I don't know. This is what
>> I [clears throat] have met
plenty of
young,
very talented individuals.
>> Oh, yeah.
>> Who are
incredibly driven.
>> Yeah.
I I I
personally I think a lot of Jenz
um has gotten a bad rap.
>> Okay. Yeah. I don't
>> And a lot of them
>> daughter and she's great. [laughter]
You know, I mean, these the this
generation or the Gen Z generation,
>> they had the majority of their college
career
in like during
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah.
>> I know.
>> A lot of people
started jobs in isolation.
>> Yeah.
I mean it it's it was not kind to a lot
of people.
>> I Yeah.
>> So I think to give them a little leeway.
I mean I have heard from people
that
they're too pushy that they want to
learn too much too fast.
>> Okay.
>> Well I mean can you blame them?
>> They they were in isolation. Yeah,
>> right. You get them into an office and
they're it's they're chomping at the
bit. So, it's kind of like, okay,
they're either too lazy or they want too
much too fast. It's like, come on, guys.
>> So, I think it's all relative. And I
think that
>> um
I I have also
met more senior individuals and this is
within the market that I had worked it
with in for many years uh creative
advertising
where they don't want to spend time
mentoring younger generation.
>> Oh yeah.
>> And it's like that's your job,
>> right?
>> It's your job. It is literally your job.
And also, how do you expect them to
execute what you want them to how you
want them to if you're not mentoring
them?
>> That's true. I know because I worked in
healthcare for 29 years and I can tell
you nobody wanted to take students and I
was always the first one as I jumped up
and down. I said, "Give me anybody you
want." I took nursing students out. I
would take respiratory students out, you
know, anybody who wanted to learn, you
know,
>> I wanted to show them how to do the job
right.
>> All it's all about homegrowing talent.
>> Yeah.
>> Regardless of your age.
>> Yeah.
>> Right.
>> So any one of you could walk in. All you
need is that one person who believes in
you.
>> Yeah. It's true. And that's why as a
recruiter I show grace to every single
individual. And if I can
present a resume of a candidate to a
hiring manager who I already know this
hiring manager isn't going to want to
meet with this person. So you know what
I do? I present the candidate anyway.
But I acknowledge, hey, listen,
I know that I may have casted a little
bit of a wider net on this one.
>> Yeah.
>> And I know that
this isn't the kind of candidate that we
talked about. However, I did take the
time to speak with them.
Here's why I think you should, too.
>> Yeah, there you go. Sounds
>> I can't tell you how many opportunities
that I've had in my lifetime because one
person took a chance on me.
>> Yeah, that's awesome. That is great.
>> I wish everybody had that mindset.
>> I know, right?
>> I think that more people than you think
do.
Um,
I think that
I think that right now, and this is what
I'm hearing from a lot of my recruiter
friends who are working, they are so
stretched.
So stretched because again, and all of
you don't know this, but recruiters are
overhead.
We are the first to go
when hits the fan.
>> That sucks
>> because we are not billable. We are not
tied to any piece of business,
especially when in an advertising or
marketing setting,
we're the first to go. So they keep one
person
or maybe two
and they give the rest of the work all
of the work from the people they've let
go to those one to that one individual
or two people.
>> Geez.
>> But I know they out HR a lot. Oh
>> um
not during these times. they do during
boom times they might outsource to
staffing agencies but also remember HR
and recruitment two different things.
>> Yeah.
>> Now recruiters sit under HR. I've sat
under HR plenty of times and I love it.
But I'm just that kind of recruiter and
that kind of person where I'm kind of
nosy and I like to hear different
conversations because I always can pull
a piece of whatever they're saying that
informs
my recruitment strategy.
[clears throat]
>> Um I'm also into HR. I really enjoy
learning about HR practices. But also
remember
HR is not there for us.
>> No,
>> they are there to protect the interest
>> of the business.
>> Yep.
>> And I didn't just come up with that.
Multiple multiple individuals who hold
HR positions,
one of whom is my mentor. That's what
she told me.
>> Do not trust HR. She said, [laughter]
>> "Yeah, because when I had the training,
it was part of a training and um the
goal was to um fulfill
management um strategies and stuff like
that. So, it's people management, it's
money and payroll and all this other
stuff, but everything boils down to
helping and supporting enhancing that
company."
>> Yes. and protecting them.
>> Yeah. So my folks say, "Well, I'm going
to go to HR for this or whatever." And I
used to tell them, "Don't go to HR."
>> Because they're going to go offer what
the management tell them to do.
>> Yeah. No, I know.
>> I never went into HR, but I kind of like
I got some training on it.
>> Yes. And when you're applying to roles
and you see that question,
do you have a disability that will
prevent you from doing this job? I have
a disability. I have a
>> I have a defibrillator pacemaker. That's
That's a disability.
Do I make a note of that? Hell no.
>> I don't either. Um I I I take um
medication
>> and I don't listen. No. Nope.
>> No. [clears throat] If you have
depression, bipolar, anxiety, for the
love of sweet baby Jesus, don't list
that. [laughter] Don't do it. Don't do
it.
>> So, more discussion on resumeéumés next
week. Anna, I will speak with you
tomorrow. I'm looking forward to it. Um,
all of you can reach out to me. David, I
promise I will get to your resume and
finish.
>> It's okay. you're fine
>> and um
>> and city slicker. [laughter]
>> But I appreciate seeing all of you uh
very very much and I hope you all have a
wonderful evening.
>> Thanks. We appreciate you too. Thanks so
much. Okay. Bye.
>> Bye.
