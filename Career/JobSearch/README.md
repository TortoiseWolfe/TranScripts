## Key Rules

- **ScriptHammer** = 27-terminal AI orchestration (lead talking point for AI roles)
- **MoltBot** = personal workflow customization, not a product
- **Portfolio:** github.com/TortoiseWolfe, spoketowork.com, scripthammer.com (46 features, 680+ tests)
- **LinkedIn:** linkedin.com/in/jonathan_pohlner
- **Never volunteer gaps.** Focus on what IS there.
- **Never lead with weaknesses.** If a skill transfers, just say it transfers.
