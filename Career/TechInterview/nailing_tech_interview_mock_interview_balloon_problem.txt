Nailing the Tech Interview: Mock Interview - Balloon Problem (Sunday Session)
https://youtu.be/P60M5VIEBQY

All right, welcome to this week's
nailing the technical interview. It is
Sunday. I did miss last Wednesday. I had
some stuff come up um for my Spanish
cast. It's like exam season for my
Spanish stuff, so I Yeah, I I missed
some stuff, so I had to go to an extra
little event. Um,
so now we are back here on Sunday and we
are starting fresh.
So before we get started
on our Sunday session, do either of you
have any questions about the mock
interview? Um, practicing, preparing,
preparations. I can never get that line
out the way I want it. practicing,
preparing, anything that you want to
discuss or talk about?
>> I already been told everything I needed
to know at this point. So, no.
>> Sure.
We did, speaking of that, we did take a
deviation last week to look at some of
the
string methods in Python library. Um, so
Mauricio, you posted some really great
solutions to the last week's homework.
So we didn't have last Wednesday's
session, but we did still have some code
that was put out by Mauricio on the
Hacker Rank Discord channel. Um,
that were basically answers to the two
the two problems which was the string
count and string replace I believe with
their additional function parameters.
Um, so we might look at those in depth
in the future and kind of break that
down even further, but that is there on
the Hackar Discord channel. So, thank
you, Fauricio, for taking on that that
homework time. Um,
>> was good practice.
>> That's kind of it.
And how did you find that process? Did
you did you think it was easy? Did it
feel
Did it take you a long time? I mean as
far as making it a class and all that or
you mean the actual code of the
function?
>> Yeah, the actual code of the function.
The class stuff was not required. It was
mainly just the function, but it was
nice to see that you did the class. That
was fun.
>> Yeah, I just wanted to make it look the
same way you would do the built-in
class. So that's why I did the class.
But
>> Mhm.
>> Uh the code yeah that kind of I just
asked myself what would be the logic and
I start coding and then I I had a couple
of bumps on the way especially with the
updating the string making it a new
string whenever I uh
>> whenever I find something. I don't
remember exactly but yeah that was one
bump with the s equal something in
replace I think
>> and then the count function was whenever
I get replace function in count was
pretty easy because it was pretty much
based on it and like a short shortened
version of it
>> right that's why I chose those because
the find yeah find index or no it's just
find count and replace all have a very
similar case of traversing the string or
strings and comparing making those
comparisons, but then they do like
slightly different things based on
there. The count takes a count, the find
returns an index, the replace updates
the string. So they all have the same
base, but then they have different
little side effects basically that come
as a result from that. But yeah, the
replace one is the hardest one. So since
you did the hardest one first, the count
one was probably
>> Yeah, I remember the issue I was having.
I was just kind of replacing just one of
the of the h occurrences
>> and then I did some change and I was
replacing just the last of the
occurrences.
>> So
yeah, I found out I figured that doing
updating in every iteration the string
itself was the was the answer. So it
would take it again already updated. So
it would just focus on the next on the
next on the next and finish.
>> Nice.
All right. Well, so let's move on to the
mock interview. So Mauricio has
volunteered to do a mock interview today
for us
and we're just going to dive right into
it. We haven't done one in a few weeks,
so it's it's good to to do. All right.
So I'm going to post this into the chat
if you want to open that up and click
the green share arrow.
Green share error. I just see the link
there, right?
>> Yeah. In Zoom, the green share error.
>> Ah, to share. Okay. Yeah,
it looks
like a lot.
This the one.
>> It is a medium problem. Okay. Um, so I
think what we'll do is we'll we'll start
with 20 minutes and then maybe we'll go
to 30 minutes since we started pretty
early today. Um, and then we'll just
kind of see how far you get. Just making
sure you're practicing the understanding
the problem early problem solving steps
and maybe a few pseudo code steps and
then whatever code you want to get
written. Um, as long as we're focusing
on on all the different parts there.
>> Okay.
>> All right. So
>> start with 20 minutes and then see what
it looks like after that.
>> All right. So I'm going to read it in
silence and then I verbalize what I
understood.
>> Perfect.
Okay. So,
there's like a an array of balloons. I
mean, they call it a rope, but it's
basically an array uh of balloons that
has different colors.
And there's another array of needed time
that represents the time to remove each
one of those balloons in the other
array. So the goal is to
to remove to make the the the array of
colors uh colorful.
And by that that means uh remove any
consecutive um consecutive balloons of
the same color. They shouldn't be two
consecutive balloons with the same
color. That's what it means by colorful
and uh it ask for the minimum time. So
it also should look in doing that should
like kind of get to fulfill two
conditions that there is not two
balloons of the same color and that is
the remove the minimum the minimum time.
So kind of here like is the third is
three because it it removed this one. So
there wouldn't be two
two blues.
So here it doesn't do anything because
there already
just no repetition of color. And here it
does the first and the last because
that will keep non-consecutive blues and
they also be chipped because it's one
and one. So that's the minimum time. So
you add the two times and and get two in
this case.
As far as the con constraints, uh the
colors length uh
is equal to n.
Both arrays are the same length because
it's one time for each color and is
equal to n. n could be between 1 and 10^
the 5. And the time spent for each
balloon could be between 1 and 10 to the
4.
The colors are lowerase English letters.
So now
the solution
uh basically first I should try to find
the repetitions of colors
and they are English letters right so I
should find
where it repeats
any letter.
So if I um
loop
the colors
and find
two consecutive
that are equal.
That should be a an indication that I
should be removing
removing any of those
uh
any remove any of those
And I need to
remove any of those. And then uh
I have to choose which ones
which one depending on cost of time
on time cost
from the needed time array.
So which one is the minimum?
And then with that with that index
I remove from colors
or I just uh not even remove just count
because
I know I just uh
with that index I
I get a sum of
Add it to a sum. Whatever time is
needed, add the time to a summit
time to then
just continue the loop.
I know this just if I just spawn one.
Yeah, I continue the loop. So, continue
the loop for any other
consecutives
and delete
as above. I mean, not delete, but uh add
the times as above. Same thing I did
before.
and add times as above.
So yeah,
and if if none consecutives are found
returns here.
So I got my two arrays here
and
I should loop through the through colors
for color in
Oh,
I probably
could loop in the steps of two.
So colors
the steps of two
since it's two consecutive numbers. So
probably do that.
Sorry if
So I will have to compare here
if
colors
color colors color
equal to
colors
color + one.
Sorry, I I forgot the L here
and I probably had to do colors minus
one because I'm check I needed to check
up to the one next to the last and don't
go further because
I'm doing it in pairs. So if colors
equal to colors + one
then I found two consecutives. So if I
found two consecutives,
I get the same array, the same stuff for
an accumulator here
from needed needed time
this stuff
and I'd accumulate the
the value of of that time
with the
same index.
I know I have to do another check
because I need to find the minimum
there.
If the minimum is uh
if the which one of those two are is the
minimum
so
if
needed time
so basically take the minimum
to accumulate to the sum
Between these two
need time color
and need time
color one
That would be that one.
[Music]
I have to start with
Sounds here.
I'm done with everything with looping.
Now it should return the the sum.
Well, it seems too simplistic there to
actually be a solution for a meeting,
but I'm going to run it to see
network error.
>> Can you hear me?
>> Yes.
>> I don't know. is showing network error
when I run it.
>> Yeah. And my
>> I had that happen last night when I was
practicing. So, um
>> I guess I have to copy a code and
reload. If I reload the page, will I
lose the code? Probably.
>> You might I would copy it and try Yeah.
and reload.
You have quite a few tabs open. I don't
know if that's contributing, but
>> Yeah, probably.
I have that that problem. The top
problem.
I'm not sure if it's copying. Let me
see.
Copy.
So, just refresh the page and then also
get rid of that debug right there.
Yeah.
It copy.
Yeah, it's gone.
>> Okay. So, yeah, it logged you out.
That's what happened. So, you're going
to have to log in.
>> I'm logged out. Okay.
Okay. So,
>> okay, there we go. All right.
>> Yeah,
>> back to it.
>> Yeah.
So, it's returning zero here. So uh
so if color and range l color minus one
* 2
it goes through a and then jumps two
checks here
finds
One, two, two.
No way it's returning. So, it's never
getting to here then.
Colors. Colors.
[Music]
Where's my other book?
I don't see my debug statement here.
>> So if it's not showing anything,
>> ah, it's not a string. Sorry.
Yeah, it probably not getting there.
It's not showing anything. So, it's not
getting inside the conditional.
[Music]
I'm probably going over it maybe.
Uh
how do print
in colors
I
colors
I + one I mean sorry Color.
Color. Color. Plus one.
It's not printing that either.
How come it's not printing anything?
Colors. Color. Color.
It's cool.
Yes. I tried to print just
just the
the index
to see if it's even printing that
Maybe I have that.
It's not printing that
like the loop is not even running or
what?
How come?
Grand I think.
What?
I'm printing that.
Close.
getting done. No network error again.
Okay, it passed now. Go figure.
I don't understand what happened there.
Ah, maybe the stepping
was freaking out my for loop. I don't
know.
Now submit
and
Wrong answer
only 33 of that's like less than 30%. So
when I have this
big thing,
uh
I'm I guess
I'll have to take two. Not only one but
two. In this case,
I'm just working for two here.
[Music]
Okay, let's go ahead and stop there.
>> Okay.
>> Um, this is a great job. I mean for
let's see 23
24 minutes 23 or 24 minutes you've got
quite a handful of test cases running
you've got your code out um and working
had a few hiccups that you moved through
and you had so you read through the
problem you understood the problem you
got some pseudo code
you got some starter code going and you
ran into a hiccup but you kind of worked
around it and now you've got quite a few
handful of quite a few handful you've
got about let's see I don't know what is
that maybe
>> 33 a fourth to a third of the test cases
passing
um I think that's a really great place
to be especially on a medium problem
>> 28% yeah
>> so one thing that I would have liked to
see is
well let me pose it as a question could
we caught the potential error with the
for loop sooner.
>> Yeah, just trying step just doing step
one instead of two.
>> So, but let's assume we had your
original code with the step two. Could
we have caught it sooner than
than where we did?
>> Yes, we could have if I just tried just
without it.
>> Well, not even trying without it. What
could you have done to make sure that
that stepped through everything?
>> Just uh I guess because my print stuff
wasn't working at all. So it was like it
was not even running. So
when I just did all the prints with and
nothing worked, I I just realized that
probably was stepping over everything or
or not even running at all.
>> Right. And we could have done the
printing testing right after we wrote
the for loop, right? Instead of after
the if conditions and the the return
statements and everything.
>> You mean here?
>> Yes. So as soon as you wrote your for
loop, I would have tested to make sure
>> Okay. Okay.
>> Writing anything else. Okay.
>> Right. Exactly.
>> Yeah. I could have
>> It seems simple, right? Like why would I
need to test my for loop? I've written
my for loop a million times. This is
exactly why I do it every single week. I
always write the print statement like
just to double check um because it's
very easy to
slip, right? And and not have that that
additional grab. So then we had to work
through, okay, well, which part of my
code isn't working? Is it inside the if
statement? No. Is it inside outside of
the if statement and inside of the for
loop? Well, maybe. Is it outside of my
for loop? Maybe. Um, and we could have
reduced that to just like one check
right at the beginning. Okay, I've
written my for loop. Well, nothing's
happening. So, the only thing I have
written here is my for loop, so it's got
to be my for loop, right? Versus a few
lines down, it's like, well, it could be
the if statement. It could be the sum
thing. It could be inside the for loop.
It could be that I wrote color versus
color in my if statement incorrectly. It
could have been a few different things.
So, that's why I like to do that. Um,
but you didn't freeze up, which is
amazing. and you kept testing. You tried
a few different print statements which I
liked. And then the only thing I would
have done maybe more than that was just
to check outside of the for loop just to
make sure like is there something wrong
with my debugger? Um but you removed the
two and got it working and so that was
totally fine. Um and then it passed the
test cases. So the twostep may or may
not be needed. First we have to diagnose
why the twostep wasn't working and then
next figure out why
um because your your kind of code game
plan was kind of counting on the two
stepping situation.
>> Yeah. But that's not generalized enough
now because we have three now cases with
three consecutive. So
>> exactly. So you might have to go back to
the drawing board and kind of figure
that out. So having the step count
figured out might help with that. um or
just kind of using this test case as a
sample test case. Especially with lead
code, it's nice that you can do this,
but you can now that it's given you
wrong answer, you can pull that into
your test cases as a sample test case to
kind of compare against. Um but so
that's my only my only critique there is
is making sure we're testing and
debugging along the way. Otherwise, I
think this was really great and your
approach makes sense and you've already
realized like, okay, well, there's
something going on with my logic when
there's three in a row. Um, maybe I need
to do some kind of evaluation there.
So, what what would you consider doing
next, do you think?
>> I'm thinking
>> not even from a code code approach, just
like what is your strategy as a next
step?
My strategy is like I need to generalize
for any number of consecutives, not just
two, but
>> okay. So, what's going to help you
figure out how to general generalize?
[Music]
I guess
like a while loop while while they are
equal to each other and then stop and
then
like why color like instead of if doing
a while but probably that will be too
expensive
but that's what I can think of from the
top of my head. So you immediately are
going to making some code changes to
figure out what you can change. Where I
might start is since this test case is
pretty small, I might just start with
walking that test case one by one
through my existing code and figuring
out exactly where it's breaking down
because the output that you are giving
and the expected output is only off by
one number. So it seems like your code
logic is pretty close. So before I make
any changes to your actual logic here,
maybe I want to figure out what
specifically is miscalculating there.
>> So I mean the only thing that can show
me that going through this example is
specifically like step by step and
seeing how is how it's working.
That's what I will do if you know if I
needed to grind on this to figure out
what the heck is happening.
So in this case specifically
you will it will start here right you
will do step by step. So it finds that
these two are equal then it it finds the
minimum there.
>> Mhm.
>> The minimum cost there.
Uh and it gets the minimum.
>> So it's going to sum the three because
that's the minimum.
>> Yeah. It's going to it's going to get
three. And then it's going to move here.
>> Mhm.
>> And it's going to check this two, which
is five and 10. And it's going to add
five to three.
>> Mhm.
>> So that would be the equivalent if if it
had eliminated these two.
>> Yep.
>> And then it's going to keep going.
Uh,
I think I need to refresh the sum for
when it changed characters.
>> Well, let's keep going. I want to see
where it breaks down.
>> I know because it's this the total sum,
right? Okay. So, you went here three 35.
It did. So, it came here
>> Mhm.
to 10
and then it checks 10 and seven that'll
be it would take seven.
>> So is it going to do that? What is our
if condition here?
>> If color equal to color + one I know it
won't because it's different character.
>> Exactly. All right. So then we'll do
nothing for that one. So we still have
the three and the five with eight and
then we move on to the next one.
uh where I'm at here.
>> Yep. The first bead. Yep.
>> So, I moved to this one and then
Yeah, I found out uh
that will be one, two, three, four,
five. One, two, three, four, five.
That'll be five and three. So, I will go
with three.
Add it to the sum.
Then move to here. Uh skip because they
are not equal.
And go to here. And between these two
will be one, two, three, four.
Five and four. Go with four.
And then move here.
And four and eight. Go with four. I
can't kind of repeat it twice, I think.
Wait.
And I'm here. One, two, three, four,
five, and four. I choose four.
Then move to four and four and eight. I
choose four again.
So I kind of count double there
and then I move here. Eight and one. I
choose one.
Uh I don't know. I think what is wrong
is when I change characters I have to
No. But the song is the accumulation of
all characters. Right?
When I compare this border lines things
when it changes character
it will escape.
When I get here I compare they are not
equal. So we'll go to the next one
and then it will go this and this are
the same. So it will do a good job
there.
This and this
will do a good job there.
And then it goes here.
They are not the same. So it will move
to here.
And then this and this are not the same.
So it will move to here. Compare these
two and then get the minimum. Go to the
next one. Compare these two. Get the
minimum. Go to the next one. Compare
these two. Get the minimum.
I'm sorry. I don't see why. Uh
>> yeah. So if we're not seeing exactly
where the breakdown is, maybe I would go
ahead and add that next step of checking
some of going through my code line by
line and checking those variables. So
printing
>> what is my current index? Am I what are
my current color if conditions? and then
what's my sum at any given point and
kind of just take it line by line like
that and say all right we're matching up
here we're matching up here we're
matching up here
and then see if there's a breakdown
there cuz going through it just mentally
um it seems like maybe there's too many
I'm even looking at it like hm that
seems weird um so that's what I might
try next but it looks like
I want to say I have an idea of what it
is and I think it's just kind of
that last character cuz if we're only
off by one, the only one value is that
last one. So I want to say that maybe
we're just not evaluating that last
character
>> because it's because I did l minus one.
So let's try without it then.
Uh,
index out of range, I guess.
I know. Yeah, index out of range.
Yeah, because it goes color plus one.
So,
so that's why I didn't Yeah, I do
evaluate it because I evaluate mean from
color and color plus one. So, it's got
to get to that one.
So I don't think it's that
but yeah we'll have to print
I'll have to print index.
I am pretty sure it is that. Um but I
will let you continue investigating to
see why that is.
I because I can kind of see it already.
But I think that's a great spot to be
in. You are only off by one. And I think
if you figured out that one little edge
case there, you'd probably be able to
pass either all of them or most of them
um and take yourself from like 33 to 98
or even again all of them. So it seems
like you're only like one or two logical
conditions away from from getting to the
final answer there. It's just how do you
go through that practice of making kind
of figuring out what's going on in your
code, what's going on in the test case,
where is that that logic breaking down,
and then kind of taking the time to go
back to the drawing board and say, "All
right, before I just start switching
variables or switching conditions,
what do I need to know about this
problem? What do I need to consider
about this problem?" Um, and I think
that hint might even be the last
example, example three in their in their
code. I mean, in the in the problem
statement and then kind of making a
decision from there. But again, overall,
I think this was really great,
especially for the less than 30 minutes
you had for a medium problem. Um, this
was a really good spot to be in and I
think you're on your way.
>> Uh, I had a really quick question just
about nomenclature. Um,
>> uh, Mario, I did see that you did take
away the negative one in line four and
you did get an error. But in just plain
English, what does that do? I mean, I
know that we're looking at an zero
indexed um, what do you call it? Length.
Um, and so you you'd be looking at
something that would begin with the zero
and then 1 2 3 4 and five. The what does
the negative one do? Does it get rid of
the Does it give you the accurate
length of the array? Um
I guess
>> no it just stops here. It just stops in
the next to the last because since I
have color plus one, I need to stop here
and do do my comparison and stop there
because if I stop here
>> and I I take that minus one, it will
stop here and then I guess index out of
range because it does color plus one and
>> so it's a safety thing. You're stopping
one before the end.
>> Yes.
>> Oh, okay. Now going down to line five.
Why did you put plus one in there for
color?
>> Because I want to compare if two
consecutives consecutive balloons are
the same color. So I need to get where
I'm at on the loop and the next one. So
the next index or where I am is just one
index forward. So I put plus one.
>> Okay. So, um, the first one would be
like the first balloon and the colors,
uh, bracket color plus one would be the
balloon right in back of it.
>> No, the next one, the next consecutive
balloon.
>> Yeah. Okay. So, like you have two
balloons side by side. You're comparing
the one on the left hand side of the
equal sign to the one on the right hand
side of the equal sign.
>> Yeah. And and that will be just always
two consecutives. So I compare these
two, then these two, then these two,
>> and so on until I get to here.
>> Okay.
>> And then these two. And then I I do my
logic of getting the minimum sum of
>> Mhm.
>> of of those two. But something is uh
still not complete on my logic that I
figured out.
>> Okay. Well, when you're looking at
minimum, what are you trying to get from
that?
>> Well, according to the problem, I get to
I need to remove I cannot have two
consecutive balloons of the same color.
But there's another condition that it
needs to be the cheapest removal. So, in
the minimum time, so I have an array
that tells me in the same index exactly
how how long it takes to remove that
balloon. So I need to to if I'm going to
remove any of the two consecutives of
the same color, I need to know which one
is is the fastest I can remove.
>> So that's why I get the minimum of the
one I'm at and the consecutive uh from
this array that has the times on it.
>> Okay. So looking at that example up
there on the left, you'd want to get rid
of the red balloon, wouldn't you?
>> No, because the red is only one balloon.
So, I'm getting rid of the consecutive
of the same color. And the red is only
one one balloon.
>> That's why I'm getting rid of this one
and this one.
>> Ah, okay.
>> But I'm not getting rid of this one and
this one because getting rid of this one
and this one is cheapest because they
are lower numbers in my array of needed
time. That's why I I check that minimum
here before choosing one to add to my
sum because the sum is the total time of
removing those. So the array is colorful
which means
>> so Linda you missed some you missed some
setup earlier on when we got started and
we're going through the problem. Um, but
these are great questions and I think
it's a great opportunity for Mauricio to
explain the logic behind the problem a
little more in detail and answer some
questions about his code. Um, which is
always great practice. So, thank you for
those questions. Those are really good
questions.
>> I'm sorry I'm late. I I really
>> No, no. I I think that was actually
great because it's always good to be
able to think about the problem and
explain your code um in this way,
especially for a technical interview.
And that's that's going to be
really good for the interviewer to hear
how you're thinking about the problem.
So that was great.
>> All right. Any other thoughts about this
problem before we close out today?
>> So what what Mario were you what was the
what was the object of it again? Um
cuz you want to get Okay. I I kind of
stopped where you started dealing with
like with the minimum and Okay, you had
a bunch of blue balloons that Yeah, you
want to get rid of the blue balloons all
the way down to I guess the minimum
number of blue balloons so that you're
you end up with like a blue balloon on
each side of the red balloon.
No, I just wanna I don't I don't need I
mean I don't want to have the problem
doesn't want to have two balloons of the
same color consecutively.
>> Okay.
>> So this is a problem here and this is a
problem here.
>> Okay. So where you should have ended up
was that line where you had a blue
balloon, a red balloon, a blue balloon,
right?
>> Yes. After removing them.
>> Okay. after uh removing all the extra
blue balloons.
>> Yep.
But I need to remove the cheapest. So
that's why I removed this one and this
one.
>> Yeah. The general premise of the problem
was set up just that you want to have
alternating colors in the balloon in the
balloon string. So remove any of them
that would lead colors to be next to
each other.
>> Yeah.
>> And then each balloon in the string has
an associated time that it would take to
remove like he mentioned. Um, and so you
have to be strategic about if there are
consecutive ones, which ones you're
going to remove. That was just the
general premise.
And so then the output is the minimum
amount of time it takes to have all of
the balloons be
interchanged in that way.
>> Um, did you have to stay with like plus
one? What would happen if you had done
plus two?
that I will be comparing not the next
one but the next to the next one. So
this to this but that will be out
outside of the of the problem because
it's talking about consecutive balloons.
So I will be doing like another problem.
>> It wouldn't be consecutive. So I
wouldn't be like obeying the
restrictions of this particular problem.
So the plus one does it like
one balloon, the next balloon, the next
balloon, the next balloon.
>> It does. I mean, at each iteration, I'm
I'm sitting in one balloon and I'm
looking at the next.
>> You can't go more than one balloon at a
time.
>> Uh, well, in the way I'm solving it, no.
I guess if there's other ways of solving
it, I guess you can. But the way I stay
in my solution, I'm I'm trying to
compare consecutives
>> balloons.
>> Two by two. So I'm going these two,
these two, these two, and these two.
>> Yeah.
>> Okay. Thank you for that.
>> You're welcome. So, but there's
something incomplete in that logic. So
that's why I'm not getting it all the
way.
>> Mhm. Um be before we go though, um I did
get in late. Um
but did you go over the um what was it?
The count and the replace.
>> No. So we didn't we started with a mock
interview today. Um Mauricio does have
that code on the Hacker Discord channel
and then we might take a deeper look at
it on Wednesday. Um,
yeah, I think we'll look at this problem
and and to complete it and wrap it up
since I don't think there's actually
much more that needs to be changed. That
shouldn't take too long. And then we can
just quickly
recap the find or the replace and the
count
code as well.
>> Okay, great. Thank you. Yeah, this is
sort of new to me, the the whole setup
that you do on nail the tech interview.
Um, so it's it's it's good to know the
procedure.
>> Yes, we haven't been following the
procedure actually. So, Sundays are mock
interview days and new problems kind of
thing. And then Wednesdays are exploring
the problems that we've covered more in
depth. Um, since I missed last
Wednesday,
>> we'll have to kind of make that up,
right, as a part of this coming
Wednesday. But in general on Sundays
it's like new problems starting fresh,
maybe a mock interview if someone wants
that practice. And then Wednesdays is
exploring the code and alternatives and
efficiency and all of that good stuff.
>> Okay.
Well, congratulations to you, Mori. Uh
Moraicio.
>> Okay.
>> I agree. That was a great um
>> great job.
>> Yeah. Sometimes I'm inspired, sometimes
I'm not.
>> I think you're exactly where you needed
to be in the amount of time that was
given for a medium problem.
>> Yeah. Now, that pretty much the only way
that works for me to get out of this
situation like I'm in right now is to
just run through the case that is uh
failing. But I guess I need a bunch of
print statements because it's confusing
doing it by hand. But yeah, I need to
find
>> make it visual if you need to.
I find making it visual.
I think if you had a kind of just a
visual drawing it out on pen and paper
with some little balloon icons, that
might help you see what's going on here.
And doing exactly what you were doing
with the A B C blah blah blah. Okay, so
we cross that one out and then move on.
We cross that one out and we sum this. I
think that would that would bridge the
gap for you.
Yeah, need to go with pen and paper
over. Yeah,
>> I'm always a fan of pen and paper. All
right, so with that, we will conclude
today's session and then we will look at
this again on Wednesday and I will pull
out the whiteboard so that we can do
exactly that. Um,
and if you get a solution working, post
it in hack rank the discord channel.
That'll be great. We'll look at it.
We'll review it and then we'll discuss
it on Wednesday.
>> All right. Thanks everyone and we will
see you next time.
>> Thank you.
