Career Strategy w/ Chelsea - Messaging & Cold Outreach on LinkedIn (Week 8)
https://youtu.be/EtaFsPb22xk

Hello to uh both of you. I am just going
to be waiting a few minutes uh for
others to join. So just sit tight.
Hello everyone. Just giving it a couple
more minutes until we start.
Okay. Hello everyone. Um, it's great to
see all of you. Can you give me a thumbs
up if you can hear me and see me? Okay,
excellent.
Um so we are on a wonderful journey that
we have been on for the past seven weeks
uh so far on uh LinkedIn as a job
hunting tool. uh we will do a start the
meeting as we have for the past seven
weeks and just doing a quick review of
what we've covered. And again, all of
these videos um all of these sessions
are
uh recording. I just wanted to double
check and make sure it was and it is. Uh
so uh if you've missed anything or you
want to review anything, uh of course
you can take a look at the videos that
have been recorded or um if you have any
questions, concerns or just want to
drill in a little bit more uh further in
any of the topics that I've previously
covered, you can message me on Discord
and we can schedule a one-on-one. Even
if you've had we've had a one-on-one, we
can have more one-on- ons. The one-on-
ones are always an option. So, week one,
we talked about why LinkedIn matters and
its role in today's job search.
Week two we discussed profile basics,
photo, headline, banner, contact info,
and headline curation.
Welcome to everyone who just joined. Leo
Hope, great to see you, too. Uh, week
three, crafting a compelling summary.
Week four, showcasing your skills,
projects, and education.
Week five, custom LinkedIn URL and
contact settings.
Week week week six, we uh week six and
week seven were uh a little bit similar.
uh both were building your network. Week
six was part one where we dove into who
to contact with or connect with and how
to personalize your invites.
And then uh in week seven, we drilled
down on that a little bit more and
discussed how to keep relationships warm
without being transactional.
And then in our evening session, session
B, we talked about showing up
authentically
on LinkedIn.
We are at week eight.
Wow. Um, messaging and cold outreach on
LinkedIn. So, drilling down a little bit
more there. Um, and more, you know,
specifically
the theme for today is really to move
from hoping for replies
to earning replies
through short, specific, and value
forward messages.
Okay.
Everything all every everyone good so
far? Any questions
so far?
Okay. Excellent.
So, why messaging matters in 2025 in
this very saturated, very populated job
market. So, number one, referrals beat
applications.
The hidden job market is alive and well.
Most interviews don't start with an
online application. They start with a
person, an actual live human.
So, a warm intro
from an alum,
a recruiter membering your message, or a
hiring manager seeing your name before
your resume lands in the system
dramatically increases your chances of
getting seen. Let me say that again.
A warm intro
from an alum,
a recruiter remembering your message,
or a hiring manager seeing your name
before your resume
lands in the system dramatically
increases your chances of getting seen.
Okay. Messaging
is how you you create those doors or I
should say those open doors
instead of waiting for those doors to
open. Let me repeat that one.
Messaging is how you create those open
doors instead of waiting
for the alum, the recruiter,
or the hiring manager to open them. You
open the door. Okay, so here's an
example.
A referral can move your application
from a pile of 500
to the top 10 considered in under 24
hours. I'm going to repeat that again.
A referral can move your application
from a pile of 500 to the top 10
considered in under 24 hours.
Okay. So, that's what we're looking to
do. Yes, we are applying. Yes, we are
not just applying, but we are
strategically
applying. We're looking at jobs that
have been posted within the past 24
to 48 hours.
After we apply to those jobs, we are
then going to the company on LinkedIn.
We are looking at those employed at that
company
and we are
inviting
those that are recruiters to connect.
anyone that perhaps works at this
company who may be a TechJoy grad or
maybe you worked with these people in
the past. Maybe you've worked with them
somewhere else in the past and they just
landed a sixf figureure low code or full
stack position at your target goal
company. So you're making those
connections. your networking.
Now, another thing to consider is there
is a very short supply of attention.
So, hiring managers, recruiters,
and alumni, they're busy, too. They
often skim LinkedIn on their phone
between meetings.
Long messages get skipped. Short, clear,
and specific messages get the replies.
The best outreach takes 15 to 20 seconds
to read and signals immediately
who you are,
why you're reaching out,
and what you're asking for.
And now we learned from ne last week's
session A and B that it's not just about
asking for something.
It's knowing what their company does and
also highlighting something cool that
the company has accomplished within the
past
what 6 to 8 months. or maybe
highlighting something that the person
that you're messaging may have posted
and that you can research on their
profile.
So everything you need is right there.
An example. Hi fellow TechJoy alum here.
I'm exploring backend roles and saw your
team just released an AI feature.
If you had to recommend one skill to
highlight for that kind of work, what
would you pick?
It's clear, it's specific, and it's easy
to answer.
Okay.
Now, AI filters everywhere.
In 2025, most recruiters and hiring
platforms use AI to sort,
scan, and flag messages.
Generic copy and paste templates get
caught in filters, deprioritized
or ignored, which is why personalization
is key. A de so a detail about their
work, their company or your shared
connection makes your message stand out
as human,
thoughtful
and worth applying to.
So
here's an example and compare these two.
Here's a generic one. Hi, I'm looking
for a job. Can you help?
No.
Here's a more personalized example. Hi,
Alex. I noticed your recent recent talk
on AI ethics. As someone building
projects in that space, I'd love to ask
you one question about skills your team
values most.
So the takeaway here for this segment is
messaging in 2025
isn't about sending as many notes as
possible.
It's about sending the right notes.
Short, specific, personal. That's how
you create real conversations. And those
conversations
are what turn into interviews,
referrals, and offers,
thoughts, questions.
Anyone?
Okay.
Excellent. Thank you.
So
let's cover some core principles and
what each audience values.
So some core principles
to writing messages and to use every
time. Number one, short
two to four lines max. Respect the skim.
two to four sentences max.
Be specific.
Mention one real thing about them.
There's, you know, a value forward here.
Offer context or a small win before
asking,
"Are there any openings on your team
coming down the road?"
Can you point me in the direction of the
best person to speak to for this
position that I just applied to on your
career site?
Specificity
is important
and mentioning something about them or
about the organization
that they're working with.
That's important.
because it shows that you are interested
in them and the company.
A micro ask, a tiny next step, a tip, a
pointer, or a yes or no question.
And then
no links in the first note unless highly
relevant and requested later. So don't
bombard them with
maybe you know uh something that you
wrote or uh you know uh other links
that were posted from other members of
their organization.
Focus on what they have offered to the
public and then reference that.
Now,
certain audiences that we're targeting
here
value
different things. So, who are the
audiences that we've been speaking
about? Alumni, hiring managers, and
recruiters.
Okay, those those three folks
alumni
shared community pay it forward culture
practical tips
hiring managers
impact signal you can help their team
maybe a fit a problem fit
uh you can solve a problem that maybe
they've posted about previously
And then recruit recruiters, they
clarify on role, target, location,
skills, eligibility, timing. They'll
know about the specifics.
Any questions, concerns, thoughts?
Okay. Now, now let's get
into a little bit before I provide you
with examples of what those audiences,
messages that you can send these
audiences,
I'd like to talk a little bit about
message frameworks and formulas. Right?
So you have the 311
formula.
Three words of context to start.
Fellow tech joy alone.
Saw your talk. Loved your post.
One line that is specific about them.
And then another line that is a micro
ask.
Okay,
I'm going to make sure that I put this
in the chat.
So again, the 311
formula.
You've got your three words of context
to start.
Fellow TechJoy alum. Okay, that's four,
but saw your talk. Loved your post.
Great intro. Super simple.
Then you have your one line that is
specific about them
and then your micro ask.
Now you've got something that I like to
call the taco clothes.
A tiny X ask and a clear outcome.
Taco. I like tacos. So, could you share
one suggestion on
is it worth applying for X or is Y a
better fit for me?
If there's a better contact, happy to
reach out.
All right.
Here is
oops message framework.
There it is in the chat
so that you can copy and paste it in a
note or a word doc. But definitely
remember
these uh message frameworks. It will
help you. And you know what? You can
copy and paste this into any AI platform
of your choice
with a little bit of a description on
what you're doing and who you're
reaching out to and AI can help
construct a nice short clean message for
you.
Now, let's
look at some examples.
of the audiences
and some of the outreaches that we can
craft. So here is now we'll be focusing
on alumni.
So our audience like I said is alumni
and this is a cold outreach. So, someone
that you've never met before, but maybe
attended TechJoy a couple of years ago
and landed a a six-figure software
development uh salary.
Hello, fellow TechJ alum here. I saw
your post about onboarding devs uh
developers into AI projects. I am
exploring backend and AIdriven roles in
Halifax
and weighing
spring boot versus flax for my portfolio
projects. If you had to pick one that
maps better to applied AI work on your
team, which would you suggest?
One example.
another. Hi Maya, we shared the tech we
share the tech joy network. I notice you
transition from intern to full-time in
under six months. That's amazing. What
made the biggest difference for you
early on? Technical depth, shipping full
stack projects or how you approached
networking?
Another
one, this one is a is more warm and is
targeted for after commenting on their
post.
Thanks for your thoughtful thread on
code reviews in full stack teams. As I
prep more
pull requests for my AI side projects,
is there one rule your team follows that
keeps reviews both fast and
constructive?
Now, here's a bonus one. This is a
referral ask without awkwardness.
So, hi Chris, fellow TechJoy alum here.
If it's appropriate, would you be
comfortable pointing me to the best
person to speak with about the backend
role on Team Atlas?
A name is plenty. If not, no worries.
You can be casual,
professional, short, sweet using the
formula.
Now, switching audiences,
let's focus on hiring managers.
So, this is a cold outreach to someone
that we believe is a hiring manager.
Hi, Alex. Your team's work on applied AI
for realtime analytics
really caught my attention. I recently
built a low code prototype that
integrates Flask with an optimization
enginned to streamline predictions.
If you were me, which one project would
you spotlight first for a hiring
conversation with your team?
Okay,
hiring. Now we have another hiring
manager. This is a cold outreach after
applying for a position.
Hi Priya, I applied to the full stop
stack developer role on Monday. Two
strengths I'd bring. designing REST APIs
and building low code solutions that
speed up delivery. If the role is still
live, would a quick note on your top
success criteria criteria help me tailor
the examples I prepare.
Now, we've got a little bit of a
different approach.
So we are remaining with our hiring
manager audience. The outreach is more
warm because it looks like we have a
mutual connection.
Hi John
Key suggested I reach out. I've been
working on AI powered full stack
applications and noticed your team is
focused on API scalability and data
pipelines.
If you had 60 seconds for one tip on
what separates strong candidates in your
process, I'd be so grateful.
thoughts,
questions.
Okay, moving on
to our last segment
in our audience, recruiters. So, this is
going to be tailored for a recruiter
that you do not know.
Hi, Taylor.
I am a full stack focused developer with
experience in Python, Flask, JavaScript,
React, and low code solutions.
I'm based in Halifax and eligible to
work in Canada, open to hybrid or
remote.
My target is backend or AI focused
product roles. if you're open. Is there
one opportunity I should have on my
radar this week?
Another one for a the outreach is cold,
but you saw a role that was recently
posted. Hi Fred, I saw the full stack AI
role your contracts division just
posted. I'm New York City based with a
background in low code development and
API design. If New York City is still an
option, I'd love to compare notes on
your musthaves.
Would it be helpful if I sent a quick
snapshot of my most relevant projects?
And our last,
this is one where
you really have to be attentive
in looking at who viewed your profile.
So if a recruiter viewed your profile,
might be nice to message them. Thanks
for checking out my profile, Jenna. If
you're currently hiring for full stack
or AI related roles, I'd be glad to
share a three bullet snapshot of my
skills and recent projects to make
screening simple. Would that be useful?
So
for
what? So these are all initial
reachouts, right? But how about the
followup sequence
and what does that look like? because
you know you're going to reach out to
folks that
a may not see your messages because you
are one of many who are likely messaging
them.
So you want to make things a little bit
unique, right? So the initial connection
note, fellow alum here, loved your post
on junior onboarding.
one quick question on skills if you're
open.
And now what if they don't respond
for a few days? So day three, the first
followup bumping this one in case it was
buried in your messages.
Still deciding between Spring Boot and
Flask for a portfolio update. One
pointer would help me aim correctly. if
you have a moment. Thank you so much for
your time.
You know, if you haven't heard from this
person by day seven,
maybe you send a value ad note
sharing the short article on API.
Uh
uh and uh you know that helped me
tighten a recent project. if you have a
different go-to resource, I'd love to
read it. So, participating a little bit
in what they may be previously posted or
going back to the first question you may
have had.
And then a graceful close by day 14 if
you haven't heard from that person.
Closing the loop so I don't crowd your
your inbox. Grateful for your time
either way and wishing you a smooth
sprint to the rest of the year.
All right. So, let's open
the floor up to
questions and or concerns.
and any reviews that you might have for
what we covered in this initial half
hour.
>> I'm a little confused about that last
part where you said closing the loop
like you haven't heard from.
>> Yeah.
>> That
like what if you do that like a day
early? What if you would have heard from
the next day? I guess. Oh, I don't get
the Are you just Is that one more
reminder that
>> Hey, I'm still out here.
>> Yeah,
absolutely. It's exactly what it is.
>> Kind of peeking your head in and poking
them and letting them know like, "Hey,
I'm still here." but you're saying it
that in a different way and pulling any
kind of relevancy
to peique their interest. Maybe they see
your note on day seven and they say,
"Wow, yeah, that's a that's a that's a
great article that they sent in relation
to this position that's open or this
position that they said they applied
to." Or in this initial message they
sent me, they commented about a post
that I made
So yeah, let me let me do that. Let me
let me actually look at the other
messages that they sent. And now I have
a moment. I'll reply.
So it's just coming up with a less
intrusive way of following up.
>> Okay.
>> Make it less stalkerish.
I thought I thought I had the mics muted
when I said that.
>> What's that?
>> I thought I had the mic muted when I
said that.
>> Like what why why stalk one person when
you can stalk the whole company?
>> Well, yeah.
And it's just about letting time pass.
It's about
coming up with ways to peique their
interest, but in a way that shows that
you've done research on them. You've
done research on the company. You're
being attentive
to the openings that are on their
careers page.
So you're offering
a bird's eyee view into your thinking
and how you can be strategic.
And this is just a display
of if hired
how you will communicate
to others within the company. So your
business internal business partners as
well as your external business partners.
Any other thoughts?
No.
Okay.
So
you can
move forward
with your messaging in a few different
ways. So you know you can do the comment
and you know to you know a direct
message.
Now, a cold outreach
feels less cold if you've already
engaged with someone's content.
That's why I always encourage you to
do some research on any of your target
companies or companies that you may have
applied to in the past or in the in the
immediate. Right?
So
commenting first shows interest in the
company. So if they post something,
a hiring manager, a recruiter,
an alum,
it makes your direct message easier to
apply to. Gives your message a little
relevancy.
So, here's an example. I really
appreciated your post about low code
tools speeding up delivery. I've seen
that in my own internship projects, too.
That's the comment.
Now, the follow-up DM. Hi, Alex. I left
a note on your post about low code
adoption. I'm exploring back-end AI
focused roles and would love to ask you
one quick question. Which skill do you
see as most critical for developers
entering this space?
Very unique, very attentive.
Shows that you're paying attention to
their feed and what they've been
posting.
It shows that you not only have been
paying attention
and reading their post, but that you
understood the post and and that you are
applying
that post
to your
your own environment.
Okay. So
it it you can see how the DM flows
naturally from the comment that you made
in the post.
It feels warmer, not random.
Now you can also do persona sprints.
Okay? So messaging isn't a one-sizefits
all, right? Different people care about
different things.
So an example
for an alumni,
okay?
You're reaching out to a uh TechJoy
working within AI. So a previous TechJoy
student that perhaps you worked with
received a six-f figureure salary.
and they're working within AI, you want
to do the same and you know that gives
you a reason
to reach out to them, right? So
it
it would be a different type of of reach
out
a hiring manager. you're reaching out to
the manager of a full stack team you
admire. The message will be different
than the alum. And then the recruiter,
you're messaging a recruiter after
applying for a low code developer job.
So
the tip here is that you emphasize how
the ask changes.
So with an alumni, it is more to leans
more toward advice.
A hiring manager, it's more around fit
and success criteria.
A recruiter,
you're cl they're they're providing
clarity on roles. Is it open? Is it
still open? Is it not? Will there be a
similar role open down the road?
So,
you
have to be specific when you're
messaging each of these individuals
and give them something to chew on. Make
them see that you're not just reaching
out because you want a job. You're
reaching out because you're interested
in the company. You're interested in
them. You're paying attention. And look,
I can even show you that I'm paying
attention and reference something that
they posted. Reference why that position
aligns with your experience.
Reference why that hiring manager is
someone that you've been following for
years. Whether it's because of their
pedigree or the type of work that
they're producing,
why would you like to work under that
person? and not only why
but a list of three bullets,
what you can bring to the table,
how you can solve their business
problems.
Okay. So
now
you can do inbox triage, right? So why
that matters? See, getting replies is
only one step.
How to handle them keeps the door open.
Right? So,
an example,
here's a scenario. A recruiter says,
"Sorry, no bandwidth right now. Like, I
don't have time to respond to your
message. I'm sorry. I I just don't have
the bandwidth.
What could a student or what could you
say?
Right? That's kind of awkward.
That's jarring. What What could I
possibly say? No worries. Thanks for
replying. If you had one sentence
that Hold on. If you had one sentence on
skills that matter most for your roles,
I'd be grateful.
Remind like see. So you're not trying to
squeeze water from a stone.
Respect boundaries. Keep it short and
leave a good impression.
Now the polish pass.
Many great drafts are too long. The
final test. Can it be cut to four lines
max? That's the polish pass. So,
here's an example. Here's like a before
and after.
Hi, I'm a TechJoy alum currently
exploring exploring backend and AI
opportunities. I notice you've worked
extensively with Spring Boot, which I'm
learning now. I'd love to hear how you
use it on your team and if you think
it's a skill that makes a candidate
stand out when applying.
It's clear. A little long.
Something a little bit punchier, a
little bit quicker. Hello, fellow
TechJoy alum here. I saw your work with
Spring Boot. As I build out projects in
that space, what's one way you've seen
it make candidates stand out?
Stress that shorter
is almost always stronger. That's what
I'm stressing.
Shorter is stronger. Keep it simple.
And this is keeping it simple through
has been I have echoed in pretty much
every Q&A that I've covered.
Keep it simple is the golden rule when
crafting your LinkedIn page, crafting
your summary, crafting your photo, your
headline.
And now when you are curating your
network.
So
keeping it human and professional.
Thank you. I'll keep this to 10 minutes
and send two focused questions in
advance.
Shows respect for time and preparation.
No bandwidth. Here's one. I appreciate
the reply. If you prefer, one sentence
on skills to build would be gold. Keeps
the door open and shows flexibility.
Someone says no. No, we're not hiring.
Thanks for letting me know. Wishing you
a strong quarter. It's a grateful
graceful exit and it leaves a positive
impression.
Now, what if someone ghosted you?
I've been getting a lot of that. I don't
know if any of you have. Maybe you spoke
with someone initially. It seemed like
it was a great opportunity or you kind
of engaged with them a little bit and
then all of a sudden they ghosted you.
Closing the loop here so I don't crowd
your inbox. Thanks for your time. Either
way, it's a professional persistence
without being pushy.
So
messaging isn't just about sending a
note.
It's about practicing the whole
cycle.
Outreach, followup, replies,
and trimming for clarity. These drills
give them a to give you a toolkit they
can reuse for every connection that you
make.
So,
mistakes to avoid
walls of text.
You don't want to do that. Vague asks
like, "Can I pick your brain?"
It's vague. Be specific.
attachments and multiple links in the
first message. Only do that if they ask.
If someone reached out to you initially
and said, "Hey,
I hire full stack developers. Your
profile looked very interesting. We
don't have any immediate roles for you
to consider at this time, but we are in
fourth quarter starting to scope for
2026.
I'd love to keep you in mind for
opportunities down the road. Would you
mind sending me your resume, your
GitHub, and any links to produced
projects that I might be able to review?
Then you respond. That's your first
message.
Don't copy and paste intros that ignore
a person's work.
There is a time for copy and pasting.
This isn't one of them.
Asking for
referrals before building a rapport.
Build a rapport first,
then ask for something.
Now, we've got about 10 minutes and uh
Key needs to start her session at 1. So,
I want to make sure that I'm being
considerate uh of her session.
So
something that I'd like you all to think
about for the week and this is you know
cadence and goals for this week
20 personalized outreaches that's
ambitious especially with a short week
and I know all of you probably have a
very personal professional and
educational schedule but just consider
20 personalized outreaches. So, eight
recruiters, six hiring managers, and six
alumni.
Maybe break that in half to four
recruiters, three hiring managers, and
three alum depending on
your your time for this week.
Benchmarks.
So
that's a roughly 35 per to 50%
connect rate
and a 15 to 25% reply rate.
And again, what are we doing that is
critical
critical?
We are taking our job hunt process sheet
and we are noting
those that we've reached out to. We want
to track that.
Want to track all that. So
today
you learned the two sides of LinkedIn
outreach,
right? You discovered how to craft
messages that get noticed, short,
specific, personal.
You practiced turning into turning those
drafts into polished, powerful notes and
learned how to handle replies.
The application may get you into the
system,
but your messages get you into in into
the conversation.
Conversations turn into referrals.
Referrals turn into interviews.
Interviews turn into offers.
Keep your outreach human.
Keep it consistent.
and watch doors open.
I keep saying this, this is the long
game
in this job market. It takes patience
and persistence.
So
this week, send out your personalized
LinkedIn messages, track every reply,
learn from every response, and prove to
yourself
that consistent outreach
creates real opportunities.
Okay,
we have a few minutes
for some questions. And I see Lisa had
to bounce
a closing the loop message. Yeah,
I'm glad uh that was impactful for you,
Key.
Anyone any of you have any thoughts?
Questions, concerns?
Nope.
All right.
>> I've got another closing thought. Um
just I mean I know last week was really
empowerful of just like how to reach out
but I think this was was also like super
empowerful of just that you know
building connections and then giving
like the specifics of like here's a
great format for being able to send
those messages because that's definitely
what I've struggled with um for the most
part of you know being able to make
those connections of like well what do I
actually supposed to like include in
them. So I think that today was really
helpful on giving me more clear like
guidelines or for what should be and
like the introduction connection
messages that's productive and you know
professional allin one. Um because I
feel like I've I've struggled with like
being so professional that I don't
actually make any progress because I'm
like trying not to hound them versus you
know I could be very direct but then
it's not as like professional feeling of
like I want to connect. So I think this
your examples give like great um
clarification on how to do that.
>> Awesome. I'm so happy.
Anyone else?
>> Yes. Um, I think I'm going to try to
make a template, you know, just ask AI
to make a template for the different
ones like for hiring manager, alumni,
and recruiters so I don't have to think
so much, you know.
>> Well, yeah. And the thing is is that for
each company and each audience, I think
that's a great idea, Hope, because what
you can do then is take that template
and add
a little bit more detail into AI around,
okay, here is a template that I crafted
for reaching out to a recruiter. I am
interested in this position that this
recruiter just posted at this company.
Based on this template,
tailor a
two to three sentence cold outreach
to this person,
letting them know I'm interested in the
role and what I can bring to solve their
business problems.
You know, again, Dr. Emily has said this
a million times
and I haven't had uh the type of
exposure likely that all of you had. AI
is only going to take your job you don't
know how to work with it.
AI is your friend if you know how to
work with it.
And and I mean Hope just gave us a
perfect example. Thank you for
mentioning this, Hope, because that was
perfect and a great segue. You you it's
not about reinventing the wheel every
single time. We are our lives are are
picking up. The cadence of the delivery
in the work that we do is speeding up.
use the tools in front of you to h to
help keep you relevant,
help keep you up to speed, and and help
you do all of these reachouts faster. I
mean, it's a full-time job. Let's let's
be honest. You have to make it quick.
And especially
know that if you're career changers,
you're also competing against folks that
are younger than you, faster than you,
and and and just graduated.
And
the
kids today coming out of university,
they grew up with this.
I grew up with a rotary phone. They
didn't
I grew up with three channels on my TV.
Three.
I didn't grow up with a phone.
When I was in college, I got a beeper.
Right. So,
it's not about pretending.
It's about
evolving.
So, that's all I've got to say. Key is
going to rock her session
and if any of you have any further
questions, reach out to me on Discord or
I'll see you in session B. It'll be
pretty much the same as this session.
So, have an awesome day everybody.
Bye-bye.
