https://youtu.be/8ElQsDJitmA

Hello.
>> Hello.
How are you today?
>> I'm good. How are you
>> hanging in there?
>> Good. Last week, you didn't seem like
your your normal jovial self. I don't
know if anything was wrong last week.
>> Last week?
>> I don't think last week was
>> complications in life or something.
I mean
the world is completely
>> uh you just seemed a little bit uh
preoccupied maybe or something that you
maybe were thinking of something
seriously. So
>> whatever if if there was something I
hope that it has passed and that you
feel
more at ease. Thank you. Well, thank
you.
>> How is our little friend Piper?
>> She's at my parents' place again, so I
don't have her.
>> Well, grandma and grandpa, I get it. She
probably gets all the treats and all the
fun
>> attention. Yes.
>> She gets on the couch and she gets to be
in the bed.
>> Probably all that good stuff, right?
>> Yeah.
>> What a cutie.
a cutty patootie.
>> I anticipating.
>> Yeah.
>> I'm not sure if anyone from the other
meetings is planning on coming here, but
you know, there's a meeting right before
yours that's the um production lab that
was still going on
>> when I left. So, that could be why.
>> But I don't know. Not sure if any of
those people are coming over here or
not.
>> Uh okay. Yeah, because I had a really
hard time. I was late logging on to Zoom
because it was just a really hard time
getting in. Maybe because they were
using that same Zoom link. I'm gonna
guess maybe
>> that might be why. Yeah.
>> Yeah. All right. Well, we'll we'll hang
on a little bit longer. See what we got.
We'll wait a little bit.
>> Well, what happen if nobody showed up at
your thing? Would you just have to end
it so you're not talking?
>> Well, actually, I guess for record.
Yeah. How would you do that? Because
like you would try to make a recording,
but like you can't if you're not really
talking to anybody. I don't know.
>> I I would probably just send a Discord
message and let people know that
>> no one's there. I mean, it's recording
now, so I guess we should
talk about
>> something
professional.
>> How is your um you've been
>> getting some nice bites,
>> right? Interviewing pretty regularly at
least from what I can recall.
>> Yeah. Uh, it slowed down the last couple
weeks, but I think that's also because I
slowed down with applying for things.
>> Oh, yeah. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah.
>> Um,
I I I don't know if I mentioned our job
hunt group has turned into kind of an
entrepreneurs group where like
>> Oh, that's nice.
>> Everybody's working on their own
projects and stuff, but some people are
actually like getting clients and stuff
to work on their projects. So, it's not
like
>> That's amazing. That's a real meaningful
progress.
>> That's absolutely amazing. When when
life
>> zigs, you zag, right? That's that's
incredible. I'm so happy to hear that.
>> Yeah. Well, so for me, I'm kind of like
um
you know, kind of wondering if maybe I
would want to take that route anyway. I
mean, I'm going to continue applying for
jobs, but then I'm also going to be kind
of pursuing that where
>> I think all of us as a group is is like,
well, yeah, if if any of us get a
project that like we need help on, then,
you know, I'm going to outsource it to
each other. So,
>> makes total sense. So smart, so
supportive of each other. That's great,
you know. Wonderful. Wonderful. I love
that idea,
you know, and I I think that at a at a
certain point we
there will be um
things will take a more positive turn. I
have to believe that. and
things will kind of adjust to
whatever this new way of
living, working, etc.
>> Yeah.
>> You know,
>> yeah, I'm not sure that I want to I'm
not sure that I want to be in an office
uh either, you know. So like that's why
I have been looking at remote jobs which
there are plenty out there but um
>> you know yeah the entrepreneurial route
obviously is uh the kind same kind of
thing where it would be remote and
there's a little
>> little more freeing where you feel like
you're kind of
>> well you can you know you're you're boss
right you manage your workload and
>> your time you know I mean Dr. Emily did
it. So, you know, she's proven that
she's able to do start her own business
and um who knows what what kind of work
you'll be able to find through the
clients that you bring in,
>> right? you know, word of mouth, you do a
great job and and and
do a wonderful project for one person,
>> then you know, you get but just make
sure and also share with this
entrepreneurial group that if they're
getting these clients, make sure the
clients are writing LinkedIn
recommendations.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. writing
testimonials and recommendations on any
personal websites, things of that
nature. Here's Jazz.
And now we've gone a few minutes, so we
will we'll just keep on going. Hello,
Jazz. How are you?
>> I just recently woke up.
>> Oh, okay. Um, but you are you're in it's
morning for you where you are, right?
>> Yes, I'm in Australia.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Where whereabouts in
Australia are you located
>> in Brisbane?
>> Okay. I lived in Sydney. I lived in
Bondai Beach.
>> Okay. That's pretty very nice.
>> Gorgeous. I love absolutely absolutely
loved Australia. It was beautiful
country, beautiful people and it's
close to all of my favorite countries.
So
um this evening we are going to be
continuing with our conversation um uh
really sort of from where we were last
week with uh job alerts and and filters.
But now we're going to dig a little
deeper into optimizing
for recruiter searches. So keywords and
CEO for LinkedIn
and it's
really
today's topic is within the broader
12week LinkedIn strategy that you know
we've been talking about. So again quick
review weeks one and two you built a
professional and complete profile right?
So, we talked about why LinkedIn
matters. Week three and four. We learned
to
uh tell your story through summary,
skills, projects.
Week five, you customized your URL and
settings to make your profile easier to
find. Week six to seven, you grew your
network and learned how to maintain
authentic connections.
Week eight, crafted outreach messages
and built trust and opened door some
doors hopefully. Uh week nine, you
gathered recommendations that added
credibility.
And then week 10, you began engaging
publicly, right? Posting, commenting,
using hashtags. how to keep these um
engagements
with uh those that you've worked with
warm and authentic.
Uh week 11, you learn to use job alerts
and filter strategically.
So now you know how to show up and who
to connect with. This week is about how
recruiters find you.
So SEO matters
for your LinkedIn.
So recruiters search LinkedIn the same
way they search Google by using
keywords. And we learned that a little
bit last week when we were talking about
the boolean searches. And we'll dig a
little bit deeper into that this week.
The right keywords, as we discovered
last week, increases your chances of
appearing in LinkedIn recruiter
searches. Now, what is LinkedIn
recruiter? LinkedIn recruiter is another
part of LinkedIn and I'll show you
something that I'm actually currently
working on just to give you a little bit
idea of what LinkedIn recruiter is and
why recruiters use LinkedIn recruiter.
It's a different platform than LinkedIn
part of LinkedIn but it's recruiter
focused.
The wrong or missing keywords
make your profile invisible even if
you're highly qualified. So, it really
is important to make sure that your
LinkedIn profile is absolutely littered
with
keywords and the same keywords that
recruiters use. And again, we'll talk a
little bit more about that. So,
according to LinkedIn, here's a fun
fact. 90% of recruiters use keyword
filters to find candidates.
Candidates with keyword optimized
profiles
receive two to three times more views
from recruiters. Okay, so the goal here
is to match recruiter search terms,
rank high in search results, and attract
more recruiter messages and interview
opportunities.
Okay,
how does that sound to both of you? Any
questions so far?
Good to go. Okay.
All right. Yes,
>> I um um I have an interview today.
>> You had an interview.
>> I I will have an interview. Yes.
>> Okay.
>> Round of applause for Jazz.
>> Sending you every ounce of positive
energy, positivity. You've got this,
Jazz.
Very confident in your ability.
>> Thank you. I mean I I
uh yeah I I I did have u other
interviews that where I wasn't
unsuccessful. So
>> but you know that's okay jazz it it
every and and John can attest to this
because he's been interviewing quite a
bit as well. being in front of people
and gives you the ability to curate your
story and to refine your story and your
ability to talk to people about
yourself.
>> Absolutely.
>> You got to look at it every every time
as a a growing opportunity, becoming
better at it each time.
>> 100%.
>> Okay. Yeah.
So, tell uh John and I a little bit
about this opportunity.
>> Okay.
I'm sorry. Just I didn't really sleep uh
like usually wake up earlier uh and I'm
better more ready for this uh session.
But anyway, it just u my child was just
getting up.
>> No need to explain. It's okay.
>> Yeah. This is a opportunity that um they
ask which is really great for a
technical BIA who is very very
technical. So
>> excellent. Excellent. Sounds like you
Jazz.
>> Yes. Um so I had two year gap but it
seems that they don't care that much
about that
>> because
I have now like in the last two years I
didn't work because of the child.
>> Okay. Yeah. Listen, you know what?
You're a mom. Life,
>> it happens. It's fine.
Totally acceptable.
So, they ask me, I don't know, how are
you going to
Yeah. Will your child be okay in
daycare? Yes, she will because she's
been going on she's been going to
daycare for months and months and
months. I mean, almost a year. Um,
>> perfect.
>> But she is used to it and she loves it.
>> Excellent.
>> Um,
the job itself is um about um
upgrading
they upgrade their system uh financial
system that is related to recycling
and so that's what they do. They do
recycling from
>> okay
>> public where uh public would uh deliver
their um cans, bottles, such type of
recyclables.
>> Yes.
>> Up to the point where they sell it to uh
I don't know how they are called
recyclable
um factories or something.
>> Okay. Sure. So the whole process they
they handle themselves from the point
where the public leaves the cycle either
whether it's from public points or
pop-up stores or or whether it is uh in
uh stadiums where they have special
specialty beans to do that. And so yeah
I read a little bit about them. I saw I
analyzed the process together with Mindy
yesterday.
Um
>> I love Mindy.
>> Yes. So she had her session. I was the
only one there. So she we could just
talk about what we what it what it was
useful uh in my case. Um so
>> and uh yeah they will probably ask me
about um yeah my experience that
um matches that um especially my Oracle
experience
um where I was successful uh dealing
with
uh difficult stakeholders
where I was successful in um
Um
what was that? Because I spoke to the
recruiter and she said that's a good
example.
Um starting from the initial phase on a
project because that's what they are at.
>> Okay. Yeah.
>> Um we yeah we covered the example for
that example for that. Um
>> Okay. So the recruiter has been working
with you kind of to prepare you for the
interview.
>> Yes. Yes. That's Beautiful.
>> Yeah, she was that recruiter yesterday
and she even said if I want uh uh she
can come for coffee before the
interview. So, I don't know if I should
use that. Um
>> I mean, I think maybe, you know, grab a
coffee. You're in Australia. Grab a flat
white. I mean, you guys are known for
your coffee. Um
that was supposed to be a joke, but it's
true. John, if you ever ever get a
chance to go to Australia, just drink
all the coffee that you possibly can.
It's the best coffee in the world. It it
Australia and they are just so modest
about their coffee. Um,
it's better than Italian coffee, I
think. I mean,
Australians do a lot of things very,
very well. Coffee is one of them.
Uh, and yeah, and I was thinking maybe
if we can just uh talk about stars
because my issue sometimes is
um
being too broad, talking about things
that are maybe not related to what
they're asking.
Well, I mean, I think that in this case,
you're lucky that you're working with a
recruiter who has been very engaging and
and has been helping you with your um
your interview. Um so, I think when so,
uh how long do you have to prepare for
this interview and is it in person or
video?
It is in person. Yeah, it could be a
couple hours. Yeah.
>> Okay. Okay. Yeah. Um, you know, I would
just
do some grounding and centering, some
deep breathing on your way there. I
would try to relax, right?
Um because I know that often times, you
know, we get a little bit nervous and
then we start to ramble. That's
something that I do personally. So I
really do try to
focus
on if I'm working with a recruiter,
what that person feels that I should
focus on. And it sounds like she has
done that for you. So definitely focus
on the things that she has mentioned
that align
with your background and this role. And
then you know they just know that and be
confident knowing that they chose to
meet with you in person for a reason,
right? You are qualified
and you have the support of this
wonderful community at Techjoy. You, I'm
sure, have done very well here. You've
learned a lot. But you also come with
knowledge
and
move from that headsp space.
I mean, you've got this.
And if I if I may also I would say um
Jazz I think uh well like even Dr. Emily
has said about how it's just as much
about mindset as it is about like your
qualifications and everything. That's
why she hires these mindset coaches. Um
and you know if you don't feel like
you're quite there yet every one of
these interviews and you know by coming
to some of these Zooms you'll get
better. you'll you'll grow that
confidence, right? Um
I I think you're getting there and I
think uh you um you will only get
better.
So can work on the mindset thing just it
sounds like you have all the
qualifications
>> and you just uh need to learn to be a
little more confident maybe. Um and that
comes with practice. That's that's it. I
mean, and I'm in the same boat, but
>> we all are. We all are. It's it's it's
it's
>> it's daunting going through interviews
and
>> and you know, preparing yourself and
feeling like
almost putting pressure on yourself when
you go into these interviews because,
you know, you want to land this job. So,
you almost put that pressure and that
energy on yourself sometimes. But go in
confidently knowing that you bring
something that they feel is valuable to
them and their business objective.
So sit in that confidence in knowing
that they chose you for a reason
and talk about yourself confidently.
like don't I think also too that often
times
women um
when they have children and take some
time off,
they maybe feel like it's harder to get
back in the game or that they're leaving
certain family responsibilities behind.
But I mean, Jez, your little girl is
looking at her mom being independent and
courageous and forging forward. Like,
>> you're an example for her. And I'm sure
that, you know, however little she is,
she's proud of her mom and she sees I
noticed when my mom was doing things and
I admired my mom when I was younger. You
know, I think that happens to us when we
see our parents doing things. And you
know, it's to live and survive, but it's
also showing her how to courageously
move forward in the world. So,
you're you you have got all the mom
qualifications, you've got all of the
job qualifications.
So, just sit back, relax, have a nice
cup of coffee, do your hair, get, you
know, put a nice
show up nice attire, feel good about
yourself or something that you feel good
in and just allow yourself to
almost have fun in this interview.
Yeah.
Uh can you tell me uh I don't know it
just sometimes pops up in my mind and I
can't help it. Uh the interviews that I
had because this is not like a huge
town. I mean it's not small but it's not
huge. What if you know some recruiters
meet up and say oh this yes it just
she's just going to these interviews and
I don't have luck with her. She's not
getting the job. Oh, also in my case,
she's just that type. She's not like,
can that happen? Like, you know, like I
think I think that your mind is
catastrophizing in a very
um that no, recruiters aren't meeting up
talking about candidates.
recruiters meet up to
enjoy themselves and talk about other
things outside of recruiting. Like just
like anyone who is going out with
colleagues like who wants to talk about
work?
>> No, no, no. I can guarantee you. I think
that
Yeah. I mean, I think that John was was
correct. I think that
continuing if you can to attend Mindset
Mondays
and
really
start try to start feeling good about
who you are because you have so much to
offer
>> and you're already doing so much.
I mean to me being a mom is like being a
parent in general is like the ultimate
occupation.
I mean that's the most meaningful thing
that you can do in life is
raise and create and raise another human
being. And you know the world is so
crazy right now.
It's it's pretty in my mind it's pretty
courageous for people to even bring a a
living breathing thing into the world
right now. That's that takes a lot of
guts because this place is nuts.
So, you're fine.
>> If they uh
>> if they ask me Thank you. If they by any
chance ask me about my private
situation, do I have help and
everything? Can that happen? Like, can I
avoid them? Because
>> what do you mean?
>> Well, like uh do I have family here?
Like uh um
>> that is unlawful for employers to ask
that question.
And then I mean it is in the United
States. I would venture to say it is in
Australia as well. No. And you know,
okay, fine. Your recruiter can ask and
be concerned like about child care and
that sort of thing, but an employer
should never be asking that question.
That is prejudice.
>> Okay.
>> Yeah. I was just
>> You should never bring it up. Never.
>> Never. you and it's none of their
business what your home life and your
family and personal life is at all.
>> You're going you're going to work
because you offer a service that you get
paid for because you are um
you have
considerable professional experience and
knowledge in that area.
That's all you should be speaking about.
>> Am I Can I Am I allowed to jump in at
all or am I
>> Of course you are. You're involved in
this conversation.
>> So, Jazz, like when I first started out
with the interviewing and stuff, I had
something similar, but mine was more
about a little about health stuff and
about path stuff, like why haven't I
worked this and stuff and I had all
these worries about it, but like they
never really come up. It's just kind of
in your own mind how you're afraid that
they will. And if they do ask something,
I don't think they're really meaning to
get at
what you think they are. They're just
probably making conversation or
something. So, in if in a case like
that, you know, that's where like
working on your just kind of like your
your whole story or whatever of how how
to answer things like that. Um, but in
general, like they they probably would
never even come up like she was saying.
So, it's just like something you're
worried about. But in the same breath,
I'm saying the more that you go through
these things, the more you re you find a
way to answer things like that you don't
want to go into deeply, right? Like just
to kind of like say, well, you know, a
quick thing and then they, you know,
like move on or whatever. Like that's
what I've been finding. Well, you you
find the best way to frame yourself in
in any situation. And like she said,
yeah, something like that, they
shouldn't be asking anyway. I don't
think they would, but um you know, it if
for some reason it came up, you just
like it's just like a quick conversation
piece. They're not like looking to
pry or anything, right? It's just a you
know, quick answer and move on to what
what's important is the work.
>> Right back. Exactly. John, you circle
that right back to work, right back to
the business at hand. You are
interviewing for a specific role and
that's what you should be focusing on.
>> Okay. And um what about uh you know a
star concept where you answer in star
kind of framework like situation
>> whatever next is.
>> Yeah. Yeah. And that is typically used
when they're asking about um you know oh
uh tell me a little bit about
uh your previous position at X company.
And that is in my mind
talk about what the recruiter
highlighted. Hey Jazz, this role here is
what you should be highlighting
during a discussion with this company.
>> Okay.
Okay. Just highlight that exactly that
that part of your work. Okay.
>> Yeah. I mean, you want to highlight
everything
that you've done previously that aligns
with this specific role that you're
interviewing with today.
>> And another thing I've been struggling,
I mean, that I'm working on that other
people have brought to my attention is
like obviously always be positive,
right? Like uh don't go down a negative
road. Look at any positive side of
whatever the situation or question is.
Just uh try to remember that.
>> Absolutely.
>> Absolutely.
>> All right. So I am going to continue
with the lesson.
Um
so we are talking about um understanding
LinkedIn CEO right so search engine
optimization
and in LinkedIn this means using the
exact keywords that re recruiters type
when searching for talent on LinkedIn.
So there are key fields that impact
LinkedIn search engine optimization.
So in the headline, the headline is
weighted heavily by LinkedIn's
algorithm.
So that headline is underneath your
name, which is why I always encourage
people to not just put software
developer, but put other things.
Avoiding
an abundant amount of soft skills, but
really getting into the hard skills that
you can offer, the database knowledge,
the coding and program knowledge, that
sort of thing, and being starting to get
really specific there. The about
section, it's scanned for re relevant
skills and job titles.
The experience section,
job titles, skills, and project
descriptions are indexed.
The skills section,
the top 50 skills are searchable and
contribute to that ranking.
Believe it or not, keywords within
recommendations,
they also count. And then, of course,
surprisingly enough, engagement. So,
posts and comments that include relevant
terms and improve visibility.
Okay, make sense?
Good. So, how do re recruiter search?
Recruiters um um
recruiters enter boolean searches.
They filter by location, industry,
experience level, and keywords.
Profiles are ranked by keyword relevance
and engagement.
So, let me give you a little bit of an
example.
I'm g put this in the chat so that you
both can understand what I'm talking
about a little bit better.
All right. So, this is an example of a
boolean search. Okay. Full stack
developer in quotes because we are
looking for that specific title.
or
software engineer. Again, we're looking
for a specific title. Now full stack
developer and software engineer they are
in and of it uh you know in very
interchangeable
but then you know we want to see
specifics
react or NodeJS or JavaScript and API or
Kai taught me how to say this today and
I still don't know
Postgress
QL or AWS.
Right? So that is just an example of
what the B types of boolean searches
that
we use to search for talent.
Now
how recruiters search and how to mirror
those terms.
Recruiters don't scroll LinkedIn
aimlessly. They use LinkedIn recruiter
which is a paid search tool that lets us
find candidates based on keywords and
filters.
So a typical
recruiter workflow
we enter boolean search with job titles
and key skills.
We narrow by we narrow these searches
down by filters within LinkedIn
recruiter by location experience open to
work and industry. We'll review the
profiles ranked by the key word matches
and engagement score and we'll review
talent that way, throw them into what we
call projects and then we'll email folks
that way and reach out that way. So
basically what the boolean search that I
just posted in the chat, what that is
telling LinkedIn is find me developers
who know React,
NodeJS or JavaScript and have experience
with APIs,
PostgresQL
or AWS
and
Mirroring matters. LinkedIn matches the
words in recruiter searches to words in
your profile. So if your profile uses
different terms or omits any keywords,
you won't appear in their search
results, right? So if a recruiter
searches React developer and your
profile file says front-end engineer
specializing in UIUX, your profile will
likely not appear even if your
experience
matches what they're looking for
perfectly.
You must use the same words recruiters
use, not just words you prefer.
Okay, so some examples
recruiter search keywords full stack
developer in your headline in there has
to be full stack developer
software engineer in your about section
as a software engineer I build and
deploy web applications using React
NodeJS and PostgresQL
make sense
questions.
Good. Okay. So, here is
a before and after a little bit of a
brief walk through. Right. So, for a
headline before optimization,
passionate developer, problem solver,
creative thinker. Okay.
about section.
I enjoy learning new technologies and
building cool projects. I love
collaborating with others and
continuously
improving my skills.
That's nice.
Skills section, teamwork, HTML, CSS,
JavaScript.
All right. So,
after editing and the
optimization,
here's
maybe a better headline.
Full stack developer, JavaScript, React,
NodeJS, API integration.
That will get you discovered.
How about this about section? I am a
full stack developer specializing in
React and NodeJS with experience
building REST APIs, integrating Post
ResQL databases, and deploying
applications on AWS.
I'm passionate about clean code,
scalable systems, and collaboration in
agile environments.
There you go.
skills
React, NodeJS, JavaScript, PostgresQL,
API development, AWS.
The result
headline matches recruiter search
titles. The about section repeats and
contextualizes
keywords.
Skills section supports the same
language. Right?
So, I know I know that was just an
example, but did you choose those
specific words because you had looked up
that they're like some of the main ones
that they search like No, just an
example.
>> Oh, no. in in so
in analyzing target job postings
for developers.
What I have done and what I suggest both
of you do and what I suggested the other
students do. Review three to five
postings of your dream job.
>> Highlight repeating terms. And what I
would do is
pull these postings, print them out, or
lay them all out uh on your
monitor or whatever
>> and highlight these key terms.
>> Yeah.
>> And then make sure that those key terms
show on your LinkedIn profile and your
resume.
>> So, you know, you're highlighting these
repeating terms.
Note the job title variations as well.
Software engineer, full stack developer,
front-end engineer.
And then embed those keywords across
your profile and resume. So in the
headline, use your target title and top
three skills.
For the about section, use full phrases.
Recruiters type. And how do you know
what recruiters are typing? because
they're the job descriptions that they
are given. They're pulling those
keywords from those job descriptions and
plugging them into LinkedIn just like
you're doing. You're also looking at
those job descriptions and pulling those
keywords and placing them in your
LinkedIn profile and resume.
For the experience section, tie each
project or task to one or more target
keywords. And in skill, add every hard
skill listed in multiple job postings.
So if all of the five job postings,
three to five job postings that you pull
have NodeJS,
make sure it's on your LinkedIn profile.
Make sure it's in the skills. Make sure
it's in the headline.
That's
that's important. It's that's why that
headline is so critical. And then use uh
forms like match variations. So use
multiple forms of the same concept
API and REST API, ReactJS
and React, AWS and Amazon web services,
SQL and PostgresQL.
So there are different variations of the
same thing. Avoid keyword stuffing.
Don't cram a list of terms without
context. And always use keywords in Neal
sentences that show how you apply the
skill.
Example,
here's a weak example. React NodeJS
Postgres SQL AWS API agile.
Okay.
strong developed full stack applications
using ReactJS,
managed Postgress
QL databases, and deployed two
Amazon Web Services using CI
CD pipelines.
Always give context,
right?
So
it's
LinkedIn favors
active profiles.
I encourage you to post at least once a
week using these relevant keywords.
Excited to finish my React app today.
Comment on postings using industry
language and follow companies and
hashtags that reflect the target roles
that you're looking for.
So,
search engine optimization turns your
profile into a recruiter magnet.
Keywords make you discoverable.
Visibility leads to interviews, which
leads to offers.
So I do encourage you
to
update your headline, your about section
and skills with 10 to 15 relevant
keywords.
Your resume, your LinkedIn profile, your
GitHub, your portfolio, it's a work in
it's always going to evolve. It's always
going to be a work in progress.
So, you're always looking to update it
and make sure that it is
filled with keywords for target jobs
that you're looking for and applying to.
You've built your LinkedIn foundation.
Now, it's time to make it work for you.
So, optimizing your recruiter searches
can be the difference between being
invisible and landing a six-figure
opportunity. Recruiters don't just look
for talent, they look for the right
words. And make sure your profile speaks
their language.
That's
that's what I will leave you with and
just open the floor to any more
questions.
>> See, we still got through it all.
We did.
>> We did.
>> We did. We did.
>> I don't have any specific questions on
that. Do you Jazz?
She might have had to step away for a
minute.
>> Yeah.
No, it's just my bubble phone just
locked itself up
>> until I got to my microphone to unmute.
I'm sorry.
>> Does all of that make sense, Jazz?
>> Yes, it does. Yes.
>> It's a lot.
>> Yeah, but you know what? It's like just
just like we we did with the Q&A
sessions that we've I've been having on
LinkedIn.
Just take it section by section.
One day think about your headline,
next day think about your summary
or the about section. You know, doesn't
be everything all at once.
Yeah, because I had many many jobs as a
contractor working on six months
contracts.
I sometimes really yeah just don't like
to spend time on describing every skill.
Although I have all of that in my
regime, but you know my
uh regime before I shrink it is 10 pages
long. So I I can't just put all of that
into my LinkedIn of course. So yeah.
>> Nope. No, no, you you you
don't. And it's not necessary. You don't
have to because you can bundle those
skills. And you want to make sure that
you're using current
skills, right? That are
what is being used now. Because if
you've got 10 pages of experience, then
you know you've been working for a
minute. And you want to make sure that
you are representing yourself in a way
that is very current, right?
>> Yes. But they are also impressed with
what I was doing 10 years ago, which was
development in Oracle.
>> Yeah.
>> Yep. You can talk about that.
Absolutely.
But you have to find a way to highlight
that
and
keep your what you're doing and how that
position brought you to where you are
today.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah.
>> And you're in the you're in the perfect
program to get uh all of the current
stuff on your resume.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. You might not have it quite yet on
there, but once you're done with this
program, you will. You'll be able to put
all those new things on there. So,
you're in the right place for that.
>> Yeah, absolutely.
>> All right. Well, Jazz, have a wonderful,
wonderful,
wonderful
interview and just relax and be
yourself.
I mean, you just said it. They're
impressed with the work that you do,
where you've been, and where you are
now. So they absolutely must feel that
you are bringing tons of value as a
subject matter expert in the field.
So that
seems to be a lot to be confident about
going into this interview.
>> Yeah.
>> Okay. Um
>> no. Say that. Say that. Yes.
>> Yes. Well, uh, yeah, that's that's my
suspicious.
Yeah. Anyway, I I don't know if I should
say this out loud, but, uh, what about
other interviews, you know, where they
also thought maybe were impressed with
my, you know, skills, resume, whatever,
and I didn't succeed. I mean, I do
think,
>> no, it's not that you didn't succeed.
You did succeed because you got the
interview.
You just didn't get that job and you
were redirected. It wasn't the job for
you.
>> Yeah.
>> Energetically you were redirected into a
different direction into a different
onto a different path.
>> Yeah.
>> And that path is bringing you to
something that is more rewarding.
It may or may not be this position that
you're interviewing for today, but
again, you've already succeeded because
you got the interview.
>> Yep.
>> And that's how we have to make sure that
we are spinning things in our mind,
right?
Like, yes, there's a lot going, excuse
me, there's a lot going on in the world
right now, but
people are getting interviews. People
are getting jobs.
John's interviewing, you're
interviewing, there are other students
that are interviewing.
And as I've been saying, it's the long
game. It's
not just applying. It's building
relationships
because you're not just building
relationships because you're in the Joy
of Coding Academy and that's a part of
the assignment and a part of the
curriculum. No.
So, just keep all of that in mind.
>> Yeah.
Okay.
So, definitely keep me posted on how
your interview goes.
If either of you have any questions,
please let me know.
And uh have a great night.
>> Thanks. I regret. Thank you. Bye, guys.
Bye.
