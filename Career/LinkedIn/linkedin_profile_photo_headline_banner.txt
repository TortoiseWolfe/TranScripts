https://youtu.be/iRv6uNV5YcU

Hey.
>> Hi there.
Hope you're having a good day.
>> You, too.
>> Thank you.
>> I'm at the beach.
Oh, lucky. You lucky wishful thinking.
>> Lucky duck.
>> Hi Ann.
>> Hello
I'm going to uh wait a couple minutes to
see if there's anyone else who's going
to join us.
So, we'll take a few moments to pause.
Hope everyone is having a great Tuesday.
It is Tuesday, right?
Hey Katrina.
>> Hello. Sorry about being six for your
coach. I didn't realize I was signed in
on one of my accounts. I try to not do
that. But like if I if I ever use it on
the um if I ever use it on the browser,
then it'll it'll still remember me being
signed in. If I'm signed out from the
the
>> All good. All good. As long as you're
you attend and you are you're like my
safety
human. You're my like seeing eye human.
So I always love to see you. All good.
I'm just waiting a couple
more minutes to see who might be uh
joining.
So, we'll just give a couple more
moments.
All right, let me see if I can get my
comments up here.
Okay.
So, I am going to begin and we'll see
who else may join late. The good news is
that I will be doing another session
this evening at six o'clock. Um, I will
be reviewing the content of what I am
reviewing at the 12 noon session, but
then we'll also be doing a couple more
sort of, you know, maybe some group or
um other individual
workups of your headline. So, that's
really what we're focusing on again
today. We're focusing on LinkedIn and
we're really breaking everything down.
Um, so you know, today's session is
about the photo, the headline, your
contact in info and banner image setup.
And you know, the goal is really to
understand the key components of a
professional profile and why they
matter. um you know so that what my goal
is to do today is to leave you with an
actionable checklist and that is also
why we are just really breaking
everything down and I'm actually in the
middle of reviewing uh Dr. Emily's uh
videos which have been so inspiring and
so creative. So, we'll be merging some
of the content that I have been doing
um eventually, but um if you haven't
visited uh some of those vis videos just
yet um and I'm not sure if you have
access depending on which part of the
program you're in
really amazing curriculum. So
amazing she's structured this program.
Um so a quick intro.
So a recap of of last week's session. We
covered LinkedIn is a recruiter's first
step to reviewing a candidate. Whether
they have been referred to by an
internal candidate or an internal
employee, whether they applied to a
position online directly with the
company, or if they were handed a resume
out of the blue, perhaps they went to
some sort of a career fair and uh the
applicant
gave them a paper resume. Happens a lot.
We always go to LinkedIn first. 95% of
recruiters and hiring managers use it
daily to source talent. And even if you
apply through a job board, they will
often check your LinkedIn before
reaching out. So, it's nice to have that
tightened up nice and clean. Now, it
serves as your public resume and
reputation all in one. So, your photo
and your headline equals your first
impression. And I'm just going to call
out Tony for an example. Look at the
photograph that she has in her profile.
Gorgeous, simple, professional. There
she is. That's what, you know, we're
looking for. Something no
selfies, something simple, but we'll
we'll get into that in just a moment.
Um, and so what what we're going to uh
cover today matters in the hiring pro
process because again it's part of your
LinkedIn profile. So, the profile photo,
we just used Tony as an example, and and
I'm I'm glad that she has that photo uh
as her um as her photo even for
uh Zoom.
Um excuse me, lost my place here in my
notes. Okay, so why a good photo
matters? It is the first impression and
profile visibility.
A clear headsh shot, well lit, plain
background,
dress appropriately for tech, casual
but neat,
smile or neutral expression, something
that is approachable.
Now,
there are free tools that you can use.
Canva cropping using uh a photo portrait
mode. I've actually seen some content
creators that have been uh focused
within photography and professional
photos. They also um if you know someone
actually Nando's uh partner he is a
professional photographer and he's done
a ton of photographs for professional
individuals
or there are some content creators that
actually show you how to take your own
personal photo and of course um IA sites
where you can also craft your own
professional photo based on a series of
photographs that you upload when it
within uh their system. So, there's a
good amount of options out there. What
not to do? Group shots, blurry shots,
shots with filters, selfies.
It is always nice to show the person you
are with your hobbies, your pets,
um,
a beautiful environment, mountains, a
beach, maybe you shot on vacation. But
honestly, it's really this is about
a professional facing photograph.
So again, we'll go over some of the dos
and don'ts. Clear headsh shot, good
lighting,
plain or blurred background,
and then a friendly and approachable
expression. Okay?
Don't use a selfie or filter. Don't
include others in the photo
and uh don't use a photo with a low
resolution.
All right.
And are there any questions
so far?
from those who joined from the
beginning.
And for those who joined a little bit
later, welcome. Thank you for attending.
We are running through again the, you
know, setting up your LinkedIn profile.
So, the basics and we're really now
drilling in in even more detail on your
photo, headline, contact info, and
banner image setup.
Okay, so for that profile photo, we're
focusing on a clear head shot, something
that's well lit, plain background, that
you're dressed appropriately.
Um, and then what you know there are
some options online that you can use to
con construct and craft your own photo
if you do not have one. And I was using
Tony's photograph that she uploaded for
Zoom as a perfect example of what we're
looking for. And shout out to Tony again
for use using that.
Okay,
any questions?
Okay, the banner image.
So why is a banner even important and
why it helps
visual branding and it's a profile
differentiation. So it's the largest
largest graphic on your profile. So
don't leave it blank.
utilize every bit of your LinkedIn
profile. Now, there are branded tech
banners,
GitHub, Code Newbie, and you can even if
you wanted to use your uh and maybe if
you ask Dr. Emily's permission, she may
allow you to use the TechJoy branding
and that can even serve as some sort of
advertisement
of which coding academy you went to and
it will allow you to tell everyone how
wonderful it is after you
are going to land that six figure job,
right?
It could be personal project
screenshots, code snippets, a city
skyline.
Canva also has templates. If you wanted
to look, all you have to do is search
LinkedIn banner.
Again, with projects, you can screen use
screenshots or UI elements, code
snippets, IDE backgrounds.
It's really something to showcase who
you are. Cityscape, abstract tech, uh,
imagery,
personal branding, or even a quote.
Any questions?
Okay.
And now within that curation of your
photo,
banner
and um you know how you are uh
delivering your contact info.
You can include your email,
make it professional,
nothing wild and crazy. And I would also
steer a clear of uh any sort of uh email
that you may have used in university.
I would
I would recommend
something that is
up to-date. Gmail I think at this point
is probably the most um upto-date email
platform. But staying away from let's
say Chelsea Scotta AOL.com
using
uh an email platform that is a little
bit more current. Yeah.
Putting in your GitHub portfolio,
your personal site, or even another
portfolio that is showcasing
uh some of your work. But most important
is showing especially if you are more on
that full stack side
um anything that's been uh full
production produced
and you will be able to customize your
LinkedIn URL as well.
Is anyone
uh does anyone need to for me to share
my screen to show them how to update
this information?
Anyone?
No. Okay.
Now, little bit of a pro tip.
Check your visibility settings.
recruiters should be able to reach you.
So, one thing that is really important
is that if you're listing your contact
information, and you absolutely should.
Now, I would say an email address is
sufficient. I would steer clear of
leaving your personal phone number.
And I would make sure to go into your
settings in LinkedIn and make sure that
you are visible to recruiters and that
they know that you are open to work if
in fact you are looking for a new role.
Hi.
Anyone have any questions or anything
that needs clarification at this point?
Would you be able to show us a few
examples
>> of people's headlines
and LinkedIn profile
>> or audit some of ours and just say, you
know, where does this fall on on the
spectrum of what you consider to be
professional versus not?
>> Okay. who would like to
offer up
their LinkedIn profile?
Anyone?
Tony, can we use yours?
Looks like Abu is offering. Do you have
your link, Abu?
Tony?
>> He's putting it in the chat.
I've got mine in the chat as well.
You're welcome to you to use and tear it
up. Oh, there we go.
>> Okay,
>> Aloo's got his,
I think.
>> Okay, great.
Beautiful. All right, so we'll use a
couple.
Let's get some of these up here.
My internet is a little bit draggy
while I'm pulling all of this up.
Okay, give me one moment everyone.
There we go. Just trying to get
everything pulled up here.
Okay, there's Katrina.
Apologies for the delay. All my internet
speed is is not cooperating with me
today.
All right, let's start
with Katrina.
Right. Can everyone
see my page?
It's doing that.
>> Yes.
>> Yeah. Okay.
Katrina was kind enough to allow us to
use her LinkedIn profile and there are
certainly others uh that we can um use
as well
uh for people who are techfocused.
So
simple
banner here at the top.
We have a photograph of Katrina.
Simple. I would say maybe if you wanted
to
think about um
taking a photograph that is in more
professional attire.
Uh, you could absolutely do that as
well. Again, your LinkedIn profile is
never done. It's constantly evolving.
I've swapped out my photograph many
times. I think you can see on the side
here, this is um my profile
uh pick for my LinkedIn.
And you can see that she's got some real
some solid buzz buzz words here. And
it's not necessarily what you're doing
now, but what you want to be doing as
well and what you're studying in this
program.
She has Techjoy software here.
The university or any of your education
information that you log at the bottom
will automatically populate up here as
well.
And you can see her contact info here.
And we're clicking on the contact info
to see what she has listed.
Perfect. Simple.
LinkedIn profile,
her email address.
I would add a GitHub if Katrina has.
Then any other links that she would want
to highlight,
any work that has been produced,
anything real that perhaps she's worked
on as a junior developer that she can
show,
anything that will help you stand out in
the job market.
Okay.
And
we will be talking about the about
section shortly. So, we'll leave uh
Katrina's LinkedIn profile up. Oh gosh.
Okay. And this has not
populated. I am sorry. Auto. No,
that's not it.
Where is this?
>> Uh, looks like Say dropped his as well.
If you want to search on that one, Abu,
we might need a different link that gets
her directly to your page itself, not to
sales. Salesforce playbook.
Thank you.
I saw it and now I can't find it.
There we go. Here.
Okay. Can everyone see S's uh LinkedIn
page?
Anyone?
Can everyone see
or could you see?
>> Yes.
>> Hello. Is anyone there?
>> I see it.
>> Okay. Thank you. I wasn't sure if anyone
could hear me. Okay.
So again, a very simple banner. He has a
professional headsh shot, very simple.
Um, he has his headline listed.
And let's click on his contact
information.
Wonderful.
LinkedIn profile, his personal
uh dev website as well as his GitHub
site.
No mailing address, no phone number
necessary. This is really just so that
recruiters can reach out to you and
preemptively review samples of your
work.
And I will keep that open
as we continue to move uh through
reviewing
and we go through and move to the
summary.
Okay. Now for the headline and again the
headline is right underneath the
profile.
It is searchable.
It's highly visible and it defines your
narrative. which is why I wouldn't
hesitate listing
as many as
50 to 100 characters, right? Because it
is your elevator pitch. And again, it is
searchable. So, it's often the only
thing people see before clicking.
Your headline should answer who you are,
what you do, what is unique about you.
And
the formula is your role or identity
plus
skills and tools and then what you're
excited about. So an example junior
front-end developer
bracket react JavaScript CSS bracket
building clean UIs and scalable
applications.
I'm going to put that in the chat for
all of you as an example of what I'm
talking about.
So for these headlines, be specific,
okay? Not just aspiring developer or AI
developer. Avoid filler. So looking for
opportunities.
Um most people can gather that you're
looking for opportunities.
Um and mention uh you know tech stack or
project value. Um,
make sure that you are
adding not just what you're doing junior
developer but what you are looking to
focus on again putting in Python SQL
learning by building real projects
something that's really going to draw
you in or draw the recruiter in or
really anyone that is looking at your
profile because
when you are being presented to hiring
leads typically what recruiters will
present your resume your GitHub samples
any other links to any real work that
you would like to showcase that is
relevant to the position that you're
applying for but they will also send the
LinkedIn profile
Yeah.
Now, sort of bad versus better
headlines.
We covered aspiring developers looking
for opportunities.
Again, what is a little bit get a little
bit more specific
with your title, the program knowledge
that you have.
recent boot camp grad. Probably not
something that I would list in that
headline.
Mindy, are we looking at React Jam
projects?
Um
I I'm not sure what you mean, Mindy.
I'm sorry. Do you mean listing React
>> in your
>> We did the We did the game React game
jam thing with Kickst.
>> Okay.
Um, I don't know if the game is still I
don't know if the games will m be
maintained where they're at or if
there's somewhere that we can point to
with that. Is that something we can put
on the resume? That type of thing.
>> Um, uh, you can and you can list it uh
in that contact area,
but again only if it's a live link.
Definitely do not post links that are
not live that or broken. That wouldn't
look very good.
>> That's what I was thinking about. But I
don't know I don't know how long the
projects live. Um you know that type of
thing.
>> Yeah.
>> Because it's not under my control at
all.
>> All of the ReactJam projects have a
version that that it should be playable
on from the ReactJam website. like they
they have it as you can go back and and
look at prior projects. You can go back
and see a prior entries.
>> Um and so there is a way there is a way
to find a a static copy of it that you
know that they can look at.
>> That would be amazing. Okay.
>> Yeah. Ping me if you if you need help on
figuring out where to go for that.
>> All right.
And Indie, thank you very much for
bringing that up because it is important
to mention as all of you start working
and uh start working on real projects,
always ask permission to post any work
that you have touched at any
organization.
Uh some oftent times you will be told by
uh a client services lead or any sort of
lead that hey you will not be able to
highlight this on any portfolio or
during any meetings outside of this
organization.
Sometimes there are strict DNAs for
certain projects certain clients etc. So
always make sure you are asking
permission. Now I have worked in high
regulatory environments, healthc care,
pharma, biotech, fintech.
Oftentimes there are ways to get around
that and you can password protect links
or you can take screenshots of
functional working
platforms and websites that you can
break out in a PDF.
Not ideal. You always want to see how it
moves, how it operates, how it flows.
But the point is is that you can
password protect this information and
oftent times candidates will password
protect it multiple times over and over
so that they have it visible for an
interview and then they'll change the
password so that it's no longer visible
to that hiring manager or whatever that
hiring situation was. So that's always
um super important.
Now I'd love to open uh the floor for
some questions and I would also like to
take uh some time to
write
take some time for all of you to take a
moment and jot down some of your
headlines. Now,
maybe three different versions. If you
already have a headline,
come up with a a couple other versions
and then we will be able to discuss and
talk about that
in about five minutes and give you five
to 10 minutes to
construct three versions of your
headline.
And then we'll all share.
How's everyone doing?
got two versions.
>> I'm I'm sorry. What was that?
>> I said I've got two versions.
>> Okay, great.
I I actually did it myself, too, to
serve as an example.
All right, Katrina,
would you like to go first?
>> I'll type mine in the chat. Let somebody
else go first.
>> Okay.
Who would like to
Who would like to go next? Otherwise,
I'm just going to start picking.
Okay, Key, uh, can you do you want to
talk about it or put everything in the
chat?
See, S did his as well.
>> Yeah, I can talk about it.
>> Okay. I took a look at my profile
because I was like, "What do I already
have?" Because I knew I had it filled
out, but I didn't know what I had. I
couldn't remember. It's been so long.
Um, and I realized that I actually
already had like the like about or like
not about, but like a title with the
same formula that you just shared. Like
I already had that in there. Um, so that
was like my my like one I guess. Um, and
it was basically saying I'm a full stack
developer.
um and then listing the tools of React
and Node.js
and then saying building scalable web
apps.
Um so that was what I currently have and
for the most part I was like okay
>> I don't see a change in role like that's
still the role that I'm like looking for
>> slashing.
So um it still seemed very fitting. So
starting with full stack developer as
the role
seemed like the right option. Um and
then the only thing I changed for skills
and tools was I was adding TypeScript.
So React, Node.js and TypeScript.
>> Um and then I three of like what I'm
excited to do or like what I'm wanting
to do. Um and so I had the option of um
building innovative apps
and then
>> okay
>> building user friendly scalable apps.
>> Yeah. And then as a third option,
developing apps to make a difference,
which seemed like very like I'm doing
something.
And I wasn't sure if there was one that
like seemed better from like a
recruiter's perspective.
>> I like that.
>> I like that.
Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. I'm actually
trying to
think of others for you as well.
[Music]
Okay, let me see what I can come up
with.
I mean you could focus maybe a little
bit more on also the you know problem
solving and impactoriented which I feel
like you did already full stack
developer React and NodeJS
turning ideas into scalable user first
web apps. You can also kind of flip
things around a little bit and make it
more tech stack plus like a value
proposition type of thing. So you can
put the React and NodeJS developer full
stack engineer building fast scalable
reliable web applications.
Um you know it hits key buzzwords for
tech recruiters. speed, scalability,
reliability while, you know, staying
clear and keeping it keyword rich,
right? Um, and then you can also do
something that's, you know, a modern and
and growth focused. Again, somewhat
similar to what you had. So, you're
definitely
um we're were I think definitely aligned
there. full stack web developer,
ReactJS,
Mondo DB, clean code, scalable systems,
real world solutions.
You know, it it adds tech stack depth.
Um, it communicates uh uh it
communicates a pragmatic
real world builder mindset.
So, I mean, I think there you that's
pretty much you were saying all of those
things anyway. So, it's not really like
um
you know that it doesn't have to be oh
the title first and then the hard skills
and then the soft skills. You can mix it
up based on
how you feel you want to present
yourself and your skills. Does that make
sense?
>> Yeah. And I did have one other question.
>> I did have one other question that was
real quick. Um, with skills listing
skills and tools, is there like a
certain number of like skills or tools
that we should limit to or try and list?
No, there's I I would definitely say
uh more than three to like ideally
there's you know five skills and that is
more toward down when you're talking
about specific places that you've worked
and you input those skills. Um I would
say maybe no more than 20. But there's
actually one position that I have on my
LinkedIn profile that is it's got a lot
of skills listed. I did a lot of stuff
there and you know sometimes you're
working at a smaller company so when you
work at smaller companies you tend to
have your hands in a lot of pots right
so your skills and may actually be more
robust at certain firms depending on how
many people are at those firms. Um so
yeah. Yeah. Do you have any more
questions? Thank you so much. This is
awesome. No, thank you.
>> Okay,
let's look at say
DevOps. Okay,
GitHub.
Is that Jenkins?
Jenkins
Docker
Exposure.
>> Jenkins.
>> I have mistaken. No, it's Jenkins.
>> Okay, no worries.
Yeah.
Yeah. I mean, you know what? Um, I I do
like what you've got here, uh, say, but
I'd like to see a little bit more about
those soft skills, right? Are you
collaborative? Are you a problem solver?
Are you a mentor?
Blending those hard and soft skills is
what your headline should be showcasing
because yes, you are all coders and you
are going to be and are incredible co
coders and you are going to be landing
these incredible six-f figureure
salaries
at these positions. It's more than
being there in coding. You're going to
be leading teams eventually. you are
going to be collaborating
immediately.
You may even move into more of client-f
facing roles or
seuite facing roles. And I think that's
you know some of the pieces that I
haven't been hearing during some of
these um lectures that um Dr. Emily has
been uh giving in some of these videos.
You are going to be evolving. You're
going to be growing. And as you evolve,
your salary increases. But why does your
salary increase? It's not only because
you are amazing at your job and you're
an incredible coder. You're also
elevating to higher positions. Positions
that are officer titles. What are
officer titles? VP SVP you're becoming
seuite hopefully maybe chief
uh you know uh IA
supervisor manager you know like as you
elevate
your duties are going to be shifting and
a lot of those duties shift from being
hands-on to more client-f facing and
mentorship and and teaching
So
you know what say I'd love to see you
maybe play around with some AI platforms
and see how you can develop some of your
your headlines a little bit and we can
work on that together oneon one too.
>> Thank you
>> Katrina.
Yeah.
Yeah. See, I I I love this and and I
feel like I'm getting to know you on a
little bit more of of a personal level
because you and I have more one- on-one
time and I can feel you in action.
Um, lead training manager. Yeah. Yeah.
Python, Discord, GitHub, Zoom. Patiently
led by example into growth. Boom. That's
Yeah, that
I I could come up with some more because
you're you're so I mean patiently. Yeah,
that really does sum you up especially
when you're dealing with me.
You are a saint
game producer react. guest talking about
that hard skill, the program knowledge.
Patiently organize volunteer teams to
produce apps swiftly.
Boom. Mic drop. Love it.
Yeah. It encapsulates who you are
in
a a short headline,
100%. Woohoo.
And then let's see, Jean. Oh, did
someone have a question or were you just
like
Katrina?
All right.
Junior software engineer C++, Python,
SQL, DB development, GitHub. Creating
scalable software and data with
supported pipelines. Yes,
there you go.
Anyone
else? Let's see.
Who didn't we hear from? Tony
and do either of you have anything to
share or do you have any questions?
>> Not at the moment.
>> Not at the moment. Okay, cool.
Excellent. Abdu, how about you? Oh,
Mindy.
Yeah. QA, automation engineer, manual
tester, systems engineer, Next.js,
Reacts, React, TypeScript, GitHub,
Jenkins, Cyprus. You know, Mindy, I'd
love to see some of those soft skills.
I I know you've got some pretty
impressive soft skills. everybody. How
do I How do I put that I'm nice to
everybody in there? I don't know.
>> You now have a title of being a peer
mentor.
>> This is true. I hadn't
>> Boom.
>> The The coffee hasn't quite kicked in
yet. Okay, I'm just going to go with
that. I need another
Right.
>> Um yeah, I I should put in there coffee
powered by coffee. Right.
>> There you go. Powered by Duncan, but I
think that's a tagline that was already
taken.
and put in
>> put in relaxed with wine. Okay. You
know, so we get both sides of that.
>> Well, you know, some people first
language and and you know, Mindy, I'm so
happy that you brought this up in this
way. How do I say that I'm a nice person
and I'm fun and and people like working
with me? How do I say that? That's
people first language.
What about
empathetic talent partner?
>> No, there you go.
>> Building inclusive teams with heart and
strategy.
>> Oo,
>> collaborative tone.
>> Right.
>> I always collaborative.
>> Kindness driven.
>> Oh, nice.
>> Kindness driven. Impactminded.
leading with integrity, curiosity, and
care.
>> Ooh. Okay. I'm going to end up going
back over the recording with this. Okay.
I'm just going to say
those are all new.
>> Yeah, I can I'll I can I'll I'll uh I'll
send you those in Discord.
>> Okay,
>> that would be great. Thank you.
But it's
did how did everyone feel about this
portion today?
Does anyone have any questions?
And again, it's it's a the photo,
headline, the banner, it all seems very
who cares?
But again, it is what the recruiters see
first.
And you know what? I always recommend
this especially when you are shifting
and moving into an industry or if you
are a recent grad and you are making
your pitch finding your first new job.
Put the more professional photo and head
and tagline and headline up there. Once
you are
3 to 5 years in your position or in the
industry and then also depending on the
culture of the organization that you
landed.
Sure. Maybe putting that more casual
photo and maybe a more
jazzed up banner on your LinkedIn
profile.
Is there a little bit more flexibility?
Do you need to be rigid? Probably not,
right? However,
if you are
working
for a government entity,
for a more regulatory industry,
biotech, fintech,
my recommendation is to keep it clean.
Keep it.
No, no jazz, no sabur, right? If you
speak Spanish, nothing spicy,
nothing with flavor. Keep it. An HR
director
I worked with for many years used to say
something to me and it I never forgot it
and I use it to this day. She would say,
"Keep it simple.
Keep it simple
and obviously let your work
be the telltale, but while you're in the
position of drawing views to your
LinkedIn profile,
put your best foot and most professional
foot forward.
lean on the side of
plain and simple and that is the same
with your resume and we'll start
covering that and and Dr. Emily has said
this in her uh job hunt videos
simple black and white
I I
cannot express
enough how Dr. Emily has outlined
a foundation
of greatness. She's spot on with so much
that she and and your previous coaches
Tanya and I think his name was Miles.
They've given you some great information
and I'm reviewing all of that now and I
am certainly aligned with most of it.
and
what they also said. Keep it simple.
And then when you're in the industry and
you're a leader
and you're maybe even not an industry uh
leader, but you're working away
passionately on that code
and jazz it up.
Everyone, we have one more minute. Is
there anything
that you have any outstanding uh
questions on that you want to bring up
in this group? If not, of course, feel
free to message me directly,
anyone?
>> Nope. None at this time. It's been a
really good session and I I just
compliment you on that. It's it's always
nice to know that people are
wellreceived and this is one of those
things. So there you go.
>> I appreciate
>> Well, you know what? I am truly truly
honored and I feel blessed to be in all
of your company and uh to be under the
guidance of Dr. Emily as well. She's I'm
a believer.
>> Yes. Techjo joy. Um another session
coming at 6:00 p.m. It will review this
but I will also be doing a little bit
more um perhaps getting a little bit
deeper uh examples.
Uh having you all add five to 10
connections in real time. sharing your
profile in Discord. So, uh, those of you
who have attended now, you have a little
bit of an edge. If you want to get some
more headlines started, maybe
some head or some banners,
um, maybe pull some different um,
profile picks. Up to you. Um, if I don't
see you at 6 PM, all of you have an
absolutely beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful day.
Thank you very very much.
>> Thank you. Have a good day. Bye
>> bye everyone.
