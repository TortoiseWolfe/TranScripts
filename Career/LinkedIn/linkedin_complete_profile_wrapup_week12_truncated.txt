https://youtu.be/ZFcqUEH_0JI

Okay, Jazz, it is just you and me this
evening, I suppose.
Are you there?
>> Hi. Yes, I was just closing the door.
>> Okay. Okay.
>> Um, so it will be you and I this
evening.
>> All right. Let's see. So this evening I
am talking about
uh this is week 12. This is our wrap-up
series of LinkedIn. So this evening we
will be talking about the power of a
complete profile. So this might be a
little bit challenging for you because I
know you've attended not so many of my
sessions and not consecutively. So you
might be a tiny bit lost with some of
the things that I am reviewing. But if
you are just let me know and I'll review
everything.
Um, okay.
>> And then of course you can always um
review the recorded sessions uh that
there um there are. So um the power of a
complete profile. So you know today we
will review and strengthen the
foundation.
So, profiles, personal branding, and
visibility on LinkedIn.
So, um we've come pretty far with uh
LinkedIn
and we've spent the past several weeks,
11 weeks, building your LinkedIn
presence from the ground up. Um each
week had a purpose, of course. Um, and
every part connects to how recruiters
find and evaluate you. So, uh, as we do
every start of my Tuesday sessions, we
quickly walk through what we've learned
and what we've covered. So, a brief
recap.
We covered why LinkedIn matters. We
talked about profile basics,
photo, headline, banner,
crafting a compelling summary,
highlighting skills, projects and
education,
uh custom URL and settings, building
your network. Part one, we talked about
connecting
uh and sending invites.
Uh part two we talked about building
your network.
So messaging and outreach. We also
talked about following building your
network and asking for and writing
recommendations,
posting content and using hashtags. And
then of course the job alerts,
filters, and search tools. So tonight
we're we're going to bring that all
together and we'll focus on making your
profile fully optimized and recruiter
ready.
Any questions?
>> Uh excuse me.
Uh so um
I just uh uh think that I am h I I don't
easily uh look for recommendations.
Uh although I do have a number of
referees. Um I don't have any uh public
recommendation on LinkedIn. Uh is it
good to just bluntly contact people who
are your referees and ask them to uh if
they're not Mhm. Yes, definitely. And I
actually did an entire session, two
sessions that were focused on
recommendations. So, I definitely
recommend you review um those two
sessions because it will give you a lot
of um recommendations on how to approach
alumni,
uh people that you've worked with in the
past. Um and then even people that
you've uh either worked under or people
that you've supervised. So, it'll give
you all of the context that you'll need.
>> Okay. Does it matter how long ago was
that? How far ago in years was that?
>> It it should be recent. Fairly recent.
>> Yeah.
>> Thank you.
>> Yeah. You're welcome. So, um, let me
see. So, the the recruiters perspective.
So, the goal here is for you to see how
recruiters actually use LinkedIn to find
candidates. And we've talked about this
extensively and and you were in
attendance for last week. Um, and so you
know that we talked pretty inepth about
boolean searches and that is really one
of the key ways that recruiters identify
and find talent.
So recruiters use boolean s uh searches
to filter candidates
um profiles with complete information
rank higher in searches and even
recommendations.
All of those keywords are pulled out for
recruiter searching and filtering.
Engagement and activity also boosts
visibility as you know. Um, so when
recruiters see or when you're commenting
on maybe something that's uh someone
posted either uh in your feed, someone
that you're connected with or perhaps
you are a part of a group then um you
know we
are able to search those comments. Um,
is there any way that you can put on
your video, Jazz, since you're one
person, it would be great to see your
face and not just the letters of your
name.
>> Wonderful. Thank you.
>> Yeah. Um, I just take a lot of time to
build out these Q&As's, so it would it's
always nice to have some kind of
interaction.
>> Okay, I'll just uh get um Oh, okay. In a
second.
Uh so um what would make your profile
appear in a search?
So it would be keywords in my
description proper description
uh and title.
It's your the answer is your entire
profile.
>> Okay,
>> your entire profile is searchable. So
you know your keywords, skills, activity
and connections.
So a deep uh you know let's do a profile
deep dive and you know we can use your
profile as an example and this will be a
good exercise for you as well. So,
um,
let's,
uh, how about you pull up your LinkedIn
profile and share your screen?
>> I have some problems with the air
conditioning, so that's why I'm just um
moving around because I'm waiting for
somebody to come. It's a It's a leaking
egg.
They're calling me now and maybe they
want to come now. I'm so sorry. It just
uh
>> it's been a problem for two year two
days actually. Um
>> All right. Um well, you go ahead and
tend to what you need to and I'll end.
Um it looks like I'll be ending the
session.
>> Okay. I'm sorry.
>> Sure. Thanks.
