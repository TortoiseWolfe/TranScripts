https://youtu.be/4Nq0BoH9uOs

Hey there, Michelle.
>> Hello.
>> How are you?
>> I'm good. How are you?
>> Oh, I'm hanging in there.
>> Same. Hopefully your kitty will join us.
>> I don't know where he is right now. He's
been kind of dissing me today.
>> Oh,
>> maybe I No, he likes that.
>> I don't know. Yeah, I was going to say
maybe that blanket's too high for him,
but it's not really.
I called him earlier and he's just
actually, you know,
>> it's a private time.
>> Yeah. Well, he never does anything with
the other girl kitty cuz she's so mean
to him. And I caught them upstairs
laying near each other earlier.
>> Whoa.
>> Yeah,
>> that's huge.
>> It is. It is. So, I think that's where
he is. He's kind of
>> making inroads with the girl. Yeah.
>> So, he's upstairs flirting. Oh. Oh my
goodness.
>> I miss my kitty.
>> Oh, what happened?
>> She was like 20
20 and in 2022, so she was an older
lady. Um,
>> she broke her femur. Um, oh my gosh, it
was Yeah.
Yeah. We don't know how it happened. We
didn't We don't know when it it
happened. I was working
>> in the house.
>> Yeah. I was working and my husband
stepped out to do something and he came
back and he said to me, "What's wrong
with Sasha? She's having problems
walking." And I was just like, "What do
you mean?" And you know, I ran over to
her and she couldn't like her leg was
just not right. So, we rushed her to the
emergency room, got X-rays, and they
said they she broke her femur.
>> That's the back leg.
>> Uh, yeah. So, you have femurs on on all
four. Well, animals do anyway, you know.
>> Okay. Yeah. Well, on a cat, I wasn't
sure what would be considered
>> was on. Yeah.
>> I know where my femur is, but I know my
cat's femur doesn't look anything like
mine does.
You know what I mean?
>> Yeah. So that's what happened. So we had
to put her down. It was devastating. It
was very hard
>> cuz she was our entire universe.
>> My tuxedo kitty is 25.
>> Yep. 25.
>> Is that the female?
>> No. No. I have three kitties. I have
three kitties.
>> 25.
>> Yeah. So, the one that's up here, he's
the one-year-old and the little girl,
she's seven. And I actually got the
young one for her because she would jump
on Panda, the 25year-old.
So, I got the young one so that they
would play together. And she just went,
"Nope. I want nothing to do with him.
Nothing. Nothing."
>> Wow.
>> So, now he jumps on Panda, the
25-year-old. And I'm like, "Leave Panda
alone."
And so, yeah. So, he still looks good.
He's a He's a black tuxedo. Black and
white tuxedo.
>> Wow. My cat, she was a a tor. Oh,
>> okay.
>> Uh, so tortois shell. So, they call them
the uh tor toyudes
and that. Yes. Yeah. She had a big tor
and her one of her brothers.
I tried to catch him because I really
wanted a male cat and he was so cute,
but I couldn't catch him.
>> I could only catch
>> the cat that I got, Sasha. So
>> cool.
>> Hey Ke, we're just talking about kitties
while um waiting for a couple of other
people to show.
>> Well, at least she was fairly nice. Some
tories are just have too much attitude.
Well, I didn't say that she was nice.
>> You said she was at your entire world.
>> She Yes, I loved her. She was my baby,
but she definitely had that toritude.
>> Yeah.
>> And she was a nasty lady and she only
loved us.
>> And you know, I just we just kind of
dealt with it.
>> They're worse than Siamese. Oh, they're
she is just nasty lady. Key, do you have
any pets?
>> I have a dog, but I was gonna cut in
real quick because I think you had the
wrong meeting link on your PM session. I
had to use the morning session. So,
maybe that's why nobody else is here
yet.
>> Oh, no. That's so weird
>> because it should be the same as the
morning, right? And I think it's
different.
>> Oh, yeah. I couldn't get in. There was
one link where it said it didn't work.
It's my fault. Oh, I That's so weird
because
That's so weird because I copied the
second interview or the second
>> Oh, I think it just missed like the last
digit in the meeting room, I think.
>> Yeah.
>> So, that's why it seems like it's an
invalid link.
>> Yeah.
>> Uh I didn't even I wasn't even smart
enough to know the difference.
I
>> I've done that enough times so it was
easier for me to spot.
>> Okay.
>> Okay.
>> I clicked on one, it didn't work, so I
clicked on the other, it did. I'm like,
"Okay, I'm good."
Cuz I'm like, "Chelsea should be here."
>> Yeah, I missed a number.
Happens to the best of us.
>> Okay. I Oh gosh, I hate when this
happens.
>> So, do we check out?
>> No. No.
>> You're just telling everybody to come
here.
>> Yeah.
I'm just going to make a note here.
>> Everybody come to the morning.
Well, I'll just
There we go. All right. So, I guess
we'll just wait a couple more minutes.
I'm so sorry. Thank you for letting me
know that key. I had no idea. I was just
like, "Oh, man. I guess I guess no one
can come today."
>> I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I didn't
realize. I didn't know.
>> I just knew one didn't work. So, I hit
the other one and it did work. So,
>> not a problem. Thank you for letting me
know, Key.
>> Yeah, of course. It's It's happened to
me at least once, if not more. So
>> Oh, okay. Not just you.
>> Thank you. Oh, okay. Cool. And now, what
kind of puffer do you have?
>> Uh, she's a pitbull uh terrier mix.
>> A little pity.
>> Well, I wouldn't say little. She's big.
She's like 56 pounds. So,
>> she's a chunky lady.
>> She's not chunky. She's just got the
muscles.
>> That's good.
>> She's laying on her bed right next to
me.
>> Oh, you're blurred so I can't hear you.
But that's okay.
>> Here, I can unblur it and move my camera
so you can see her.
>> Oh, I would love that cuz I'm animal
starved.
>> Oh, here. Let me see if I can unplug.
>> So animal starved.
Oops.
Everything is
I don't know if you can see it. There
you go.
>> Oh, wait. Um, you actually are fro Oh,
there she is. Oh, how precious. She's
just curled up.
>> Yeah, normally she sits We've got a bed
right behind. Normally, she sits and be
is neighborhood watch. Uh, but I think
she's had enough of that today after
having to bark at uh a couple of uh mail
deliveries.
>> Okay. Okay. Okay, fair enough.
>> I got to take a break. I'm gonna lay on
the floor.
>> Hi, Jazz. How are you?
>> Hi.
>> How are you?
>> Good, good, good, good,
good, good, good.
>> They were up there laying really close
to each other.
>> Oh, the kitties. Wow.
>> I think they might be becoming friends
finally.
Well, don't say don't say that too loud.
>> No, because they don't want you to see
them.
>> No, no, no, no. Not at all.
>> Watch me.
>> All right, friends. I'm just going to
kick this off and not waste any more
time. I am so sorry that I had the
incorrect link um in uh in there. So we
have done a lot over the past nine
weeks. Um uh and
what we have done is really set up our
storefront well what I call the
storefront uh for our LinkedIn profile.
So week one we you know talked about why
LinkedIn matters and we un started to
frame and understand
um how LinkedIn is a job search tool and
a way for us to be vis visible. Right?
Week two we did profile basics with the
photo headline banner contact info. Week
three, we talked about crafting a
compelling summary.
Week four, highlighting skills,
projects, and education.
Week five, custom URL and settings.
Week six, building your network part
one. We did our building our network
part two. in week seven. Um, part one
was really about connecting and invites.
Part two was keeping relationships warm
and authentic.
Um,
week eight we talked about messaging and
cold outreach to alumni,
recruiters, hiring managers.
Last week, which was our week nine, we
talked about how to ask and write great
recommendations.
Okay? And you know, we this engagement
that we're going to talk about this week
is really the next steps. I is the the
next sort of elevating step to
everything that we discussed.
And what will we be talking about this
week is engaging with LinkedIn.
So posting content, commenting on posts,
and using hashtags. And we do all of
this because it makes you even more
visible to the folks that you are
networking with. So after you're
applying to the to jobs,
you're then going to those companies
that you've applied to.
You're doing a little bit of research,
looking to see if when you apply, if the
poster of that job is listed, if so,
you're looking that person up. You're
connecting with them. You're sending
them a nice note, letting them know your
interest,
pulling something from maybe she had
posted or the um any sort of publicity
or writeups in professional
um magazines or industry magazines,
digital platforms, podcasts, all of that
stuff. mentioning those things to kind
of get their attention and let them know
like, hey, I'm paying attention to the
company. This is what I
thought really piqued my interest. I
heard this podcast or I read this
article
and also, by the way, I just applied for
this full stack developer position that
you had listed.
Here's my resume. Here's my information.
And then you stay in touch. Well, what
you do furthering your relationship and
networking with this person is you're
keeping an eye out
on what they're posting. You might even
go even further
and find out what LinkedIn groups they
belong to so that you can become a
member of that group and start seeing
some of the um information that they are
posting. So it's it's
there's so many rabbit holes that you
can go down here. And again, what have I
been saying with
what have I been saying about this job
market? It's all about the long long
game. This is going to take a minute.
So, it's establishing these
relationships so that you have options
because I firmly believe that when
things pick up,
people will start reaching out to you
instead of you constantly reaching out
to hiring leads and recruiters. Okay. So
what
what are first the best practices in
posting and what exactly are you
supposed to be posting? Well, that's why
I mentioned perhaps you might want to
take a look at some of the groups that
are on LinkedIn. I'm sure there's plenty
of groups for technical recruiters,
plenty of groups
around any of the programs or databases
that you use, low code jobs, full stack
jobs. If you're looking for BA jobs or
QA positions,
I can guarantee there are groups for
pretty much everything, Michelle. There
are probably groups for cat lovers
on LinkedIn. I I can guarantee it. So,
you know, and you never know what you're
going to find in some of these groups,
but there are best practices. So, a
couple of the best practices.
Frequency.
Posting two to three times per week is
the sweet spots for staying visible
without oversharing.
And again, this doesn't have to be a
sort of like mentally brain draining
project. This is simple. You're looking
through the LinkedIn feed, seeing what
comes based on who what group you belong
to, who you're following, and then
you're commenting on what they're
posting. And then, of course, you are
also posting. You may even want to
repost to your LinkedIn family or
community
something that you read that really piqu
your interest or got you thinking or
resonated with you. You might want to
repost that, but you want to say
something about that repost. You may
have been working on a
uh TechJoy project
for a very long time into the wee hours
of the morning. And maybe you just want
to get on LinkedIn and do a shout out to
the folks that you were partnering with
and working with at TechJoy to complete
this project.
You may be working on a project for
TechJoy
and
you're stumped.
You you have a challen like you're
having a challenging time solving this
coding issue. Throw it on LinkedIn.
This is how you start building
relationships. Okay. So these are what
we call the types of posts that have
been working in 2025. It's a very
special job market. So we need to get
very creative and unique and stand out.
So learning journey posts what are they?
what you're coding, what you are
building, and as I just mentioned, what
you're struggling with, learning journey
posts,
sharing client or project work with
insight. So, not I made this, but
here's what I've made and here's why it
matters.
So showing that example, sharing client
or project work, but adding some real
insight behind it. Maybe this was a
project that you that really
brought you to another level of
frustration.
Maybe it was so challenging that it took
you so long to do, but when you finally
completed this project, you were so
proud of yourself.
Post the project on LinkedIn. I am so
proud of this project. This project kept
me up at night. I used this coding
framework. I used this type of code
and this is what I learned.
This is what the challenge was. Have any
of you out there in LinkedIn had the
same issue? How did you solve the
problem? Like it's a community of people
that could actually help you, right? And
then of course industry commentary.
So, your reaction to AI, coding trends,
tech hiring, like these are all ways to
grab attention and start building your
network and start building
relationships,
gratitude or recognition posts, as I
mentioned when we first started this
conversation,
right? Shout out throwing a shout out to
a mentor. Maybe you know Michelle Jazz,
maybe you guys have or will have Key as
your peer mentor. Maybe she helps you
get through a challenging time in this
program. Maybe she helps you solve a
coding issue. Maybe it's Alyssa. Maybe
it's Coach Marcy in her mindset Monday.
Maybe she said something to you that
really changed your perspective about
the job hunt. These are all valid
postings 100%.
So, and there is a structure to this,
you know, it's there is something uh
when you're posting or when someone
posts something on LinkedIn,
you can only see a portion of their
opening sentence, which we refer to as
the hook line. So this hook line needs
to be like really needs to pop and draw
you in because you know you only see the
preview of that hook line and then you
see see more where you can click the see
more and it will show the whole thing.
So, make sure that this is really
uh a hook line that draws you in. And
then the rest is, you know, three to
five short sentences
and end with a call to action,
right? Curious how others are
approaching this.
The tone is confident,
professional,
personal enough to show personality, but
avoid sounding robotic and generic.
Yeah.
Any questions, concerns, thoughts,
comments?
Good. Okay.
So,
commenting on posts,
why does it matter that you comment on
posts? Well, recruiters often find
candidates
through their comments
on thought leadership posts. Recruiters
care about what you think.
They like to see
folks interacting them with people from
their company, with people from other
companies, with other recruiters.
Because don't forget that when you
comment on a post or you post something,
everyone can see it. Even if you're
commenting on someone else's post. And
this is, you know, as as vast
as it feels the world is, it's actually
very small.
So you never know who's connected to
whom, right?
So
best practices here, add value every
time. Don't write great post,
right? This is spot on. I've been
applying this in my coding projects by
dot dot dot. Have some sort of
engagement.
Comment on recruiter and hiring manager
posts. It puts you directly on their
radar.
That's why connecting with these folks,
it isn't just about
being in touch with these people to let
them know that you are a looking for
work and b
um applying to the the jobs that they're
posting.
It's not one way. It's a two-way street.
It's a conversation. It's engagement.
It's networking. And again, it's a small
world. You never know who is connected
to whom.
You could apply to a position,
send a note to the recruiter. The
recruiter can look at your profile and
see, oh, isn't that interesting?
Michelle is actually connected to Key,
who works at this other company. And I
actually know Key. Let me reach out to
Key and see if she's ever been in touch
with Michelle or even if she knows her.
It's it's about
being visible enough to and sharing
enough to show people that you are open
to engagement, open to collaboration
because being open to engagement and
collaboration on a platform site like
LinkedIn is a little bit of a screenshot
into how you will present yourself on
the job.
just a little like peeking through the
keyhole.
>> There's a saying in there's a saying in
theater. There's 10 people in theater
and they all know each other.
>> Yeah.
>> And it is true.
>> That's a good one.
>> It works.
>> That's a good one.
>> Yeah. Yeah. And it's true. It is so
true.
>> I like that one. Thank you, Michelle.
That's excellent. I love it. Love that.
Um, and then of course join conversation
in tech groups or you know and use your
hashtags
hashwomen who code
aai #careergrowth
you know and and listen you don't have
to spend hours on this 10 to 15 minutes
a day is enough to stay visible
so yes
>> what is a hashtag I'm Sorry, I don't
understand it.
>> No, no problem. It draws it it
brings you into
um and and highlights a topic,
>> right?
>> Okay. Okay.
>> So, let me see how I can better explain
this.
>> I've never been good at that. I don't
know what they do.
Is it just a a a a topic or does it
actually like it doesn't go anywhere?
The hashtag doesn't go anywhere. It's
just like this is what I'm interested.
This is what I do. Da da da. That kind
of thing. You know a a hashtag on a
keyword word search
it is a keyword or phrase right preceded
by a hashtag like the number sign
>> which it basically makes your content
discoverable.
>> So here's essentially what it does. It
categorizes your posts.
>> So hashtags tell LinkedIn what your
content is about. For example,
hashtag. So that's the number sign full
stack developer
>> signals your post is related to
development.
>> It expands visibility as well. So when
you use a hashtag, your post can appear
in the feed of people following your
searching
that hashtag. So if someone say if you
don't even know key,
>> right? but she's following the hashtag
fullstack developer.
>> She'll key will be able to find that
even if they aren't connected to you. So
even if key is not connected to you when
you use a hashtag your post can appear
in the feeds of people following your
searching
>> uh following or searching that hashtag
and that can be recruiters
uh alumni hiring leads and that's why
hashtags are important to recruiters
because we can actually find people that
way. It it's a searchable item.
>> Okay.
>> Yeah. And it it also connects you to
communities. So like active hashtags
like perfect example for the three of
you hashtag women who code.
It gathers professionals around a shared
topic. So commenting or posting with
those hashtags puts you into that
conversation even if you're not
connected. So
>> okay
>> and then there are like signal it
signals keywords to recruiters. So as I
mentioned recruiters often track
hashtags to source talent pools such as
entry-level developer or
open to work.
So
in 2025
what I have been hearing is
um best practice that is you use three
to five hashtags max and you know mix
mix mix them up. Right? So for like
someone like me who might be
um sourcing and hiring for a software
engineer
and I make a note or I send a post out
on LinkedIn and I say
um you know give a call to action um I'm
working on a six-month contract for a
software developer working on a CPG
at a top agency in New York City. This
contract can be remote but must be
located within the US
and
here's my information if you're
interested in applying.
I might use
#tech
#
software developer #Cpg #advertising,
you know, and you have niche hashtags
like
Hectori,
right? So
check activity before using a hashtag.
So, like if nobody's engaging with it,
it won't help your visibility.
But that's essentially
what a hashtag is.
>> Thank you.
>> You're welcome. You're so welcome.
Um,
what happened here? Okay, so
what catches recruiters eyes in 2025?
Did you have a question, Jess? Uh I do
it's it's not related to particularly
what you're saying now. I just uh I just
wanted at some stage to ask you about
two things. Uh one is um my last manager
that was two years ago
uh sent very nice letter to three
recruiters that he knows uh about me to
contact me. That was like few months ago
now. So I basically now have to reach
out because they didn't contact me and
uh he he sent me my resume and see you
know I don't know what to say what to do
how to approach them as I mentioned I
have interviews probably 10 interviews I
had one two weeks ago I was sick with
flu just that night before the interview
so I constantly have these problems
um basically so my question is How
should I approach these three
recruiters?
And the second question is how can I
practice? Is there any AI or are there
any meetings where I can practice
talking? Because I talk all the all day
with my well when she's not in daycare.
She's not every day. I talk Serbian um
with my toddler who is two years old
toddler. So
when I get to the interviews, my
language, my business English is a
little bit
not that
at that level that I'm expected to
provide that was two years ago when I
was a senior BA. Anyway, those are two
burning questions that I need to ask you
anytime when you have time.
>> Yeah. No. Um do uh message me if you can
on Discord so that we can schedule some
time to connect
>> and discuss that you know individually.
>> Um okay.
>> You know these are questions that I'll
likely be addressing down the road in
other Q&A sessions. Um, but for now,
I've been handling these types of
questions sort of one-on-one as they
come up for folks because it's also sort
of personal and individual for each uh
person who's starting to interview. Each
person has their areas where they sort
of freeze or have little hiccups. So, it
is also individual to each person.
Uh I can actually send you feedback from
one of my interview panelists in the
past. Uh and that that was really
excellent and it was all about
concentrate on what you're saying. Don't
go um side to other side topics
answer the question. Yes. Those type of
things that again I was good at two
years ago but as somebody said you have
a different brain now. So, I don't know.
That's it. Yeah.
>> Okay, great. So,
>> yeah. So, message me on on Discord and
we can schedule time to connect next
week.
>> Thanks.
>> You're welcome.
So, what catches recruiters eyes in
2025? So, content that signals
employability.
So posts showing you solving problems or
sharing lessons that you've learned. And
this is perfect for folks like you
because you are in a boot camp that
offers you the opportunity to work on
real work with real clients once you get
to a certain phase of the program.
Right? So even if you're not in a
certain phase of the program,
you still might be undergoing some sort
of challenge with
uh some programming language or database
or as Jazz just mentioned,
she's having, you know, it's it's about
remaining focused in her interviews
and
um
she needs a little bit help. Here's
hope.
Um with her with her interviews.
So, you know, this happens and sometimes
people freeze. Hi, Hope. How are you?
Nice to see you.
And you know what? It happens to all of
us. So, it's about
not sharing personal things on LinkedIn
and posting, but it's about
having the ability to
post something that you might be
challenged with within a certain
capability, whether it's coding or
interview cadence or resume building.
It's everyone has these issues and
putting it and posting it on LinkedIn
can not only help answer your questions
or uh gain insight on the issue that you
might be having, but it also gives you
the opportunity to network. So,
Michelle,
at what level should you start posting?
Uh because they don't want to see really
basic stuff, right? You know what?
Everybody is everyone was a beginner at
at one point, Michelle. And say you're
say, you know, you're at the low code
level and what you really feel confident
about is WordPress,
>> look for a WordPress group,
>> okay?
>> You know what I mean? like,
>> okay,
>> it
it's not really about impressing anyone.
It's about
visibly representing yourself
in a way that is engaging and
professional.
>> Okay.
>> Um, hope just to like catch you up. Um
we are talking about engaging with
LinkedIn and posting content,
commenting on posts and also hashtags.
So um if if you want to stay just a
little bit past seven and you want me to
review anything, you let me know. Um,
but and of course you can always revisit
and rewatch this if you'd like. Um, but
you know, we were talking about posting
content and best practices.
Um, you know, the types of of posts,
learning journey posts. So, posting
about what you're coding, building, or
struggling with, sharing client or
content work. um industry commentary. So
like um your reaction to AI or tech
hiring coding trends or
maybe hope you and key have been working
on a project together and you both were
working into the wee hours of the
morning and you just want to give her a
shout out on LinkedIn and say thanks for
being my ride or die last night. uh key
and you know by the way everyone this is
what we've been working on and it's
really exciting these are our challenges
anybody else have these issues you might
a hiring lead or someone that you may
have been networking with on LinkedIn
may say oh hey yeah I've had this issue
before
so you know it's it's all about
continuing what we've been talking about
uh over the past couple of weeks with
networking. Michelle, I saw that you um
had your hand up.
>> Yeah. I just wanted to uh say two real
quick things in case hope didn't know. I
didn't even think about following a
hashtag to make sure it was active. So,
I wanted her to hear that. And then I
wanted to say cuz I've seen people with
like 20 hashtags
>> and I guess that's too much.
>> Yeah, you don't have to do that. What?
You know what, Michelle? What have I
been saying since you
>> make it count?
>> Make it count, but keep it simple.
>> Keep it simple.
>> Okay.
>> It does not have to be elaborate. and
Hope, what we were talking about um just
before you joined was, you know,
including a hashtag when you join
conversations,
you know, in in tech groups or um if
you're posting something
on uh LinkedIn. Um and what I had
mentioned about hashtags is that the
importance of hashtags is you know uh a
hashtag on LinkedIn is a keyword or
phrase preceded by a hashtag that makes
your content discoverable right so it'll
categorize your post it expands
visibility it connects you to
communities
active hashtags likewomen
who code. That's you.
That's you. And you know what? I'm sure
I guarantee you
um women who code, I'm sure that's a
group on LinkedIn.
>> Yeah, probably
>> join it. I'm sure it will provide some
very interesting insight. Um you know,
and then signal it keyword or hashtags
signals keywords to recruiters. So we
often track hashtags to source talent
pools, right? #opentowork
# fullstack developer # entrylevel
developer.
That happens. So I just want to make
sure you're up to speed and not lost. So
um thank you everyone for allowing me to
get hope up to speed and repeat that.
Um, and as I was saying, so what catches
the eyes of recruiters? Content that
signals employability.
What is that? Posts showing you solving
problems or sharing
possibly a lesson that you learned. I
was having so much problems with this
React code.
I worked with my teammate Michelle
and we solved it. Has anyone else come
across this issue? Even play around with
it, you know, evidence of collaboration,
worked with classmates on maybe you all
finished your project and it was a great
project and maybe you want to shout out
your team.
We just finished a project in TechJoy
Academy and this is what we've been
working on. We're excited that this has
launched. Of course, making sure with
Alyssa that you have permission to post
something like that to the public.
But this is all a way for you to be
visible and show that you are employable
because this again is a mirror of how
you will engage on the job.
So thoughtful engagement with industry
changes you can do that too. layoffs, AI
hiring trends,
hires.
Maybe Key wants to post how proud she is
and how happy she is that her her
teammate Hope landed a job.
Maybe she wants to celebrate that.
Worth celebrating and worth announcing
in this job market. I will tell you
that.
So why not, right? Why not? And
engagement metrics that recruiters
notice consistency over time matters
more than vi vital hits or viral hits.
All right. The substance
of what you are posting and consistency
in those posts.
So a candidate posting once a month
versus one posting two to three times
weekly. The secondly is the second
candidate is more likely to get
contacted.
Right? So using this engagement to
interact and network.
Now,
what I would like you to think about,
and we don't have time to stop and have
you do this, but I really would like you
to think deeply about this.
Find one post in your feed on LinkedIn
and write a strong value adding comment.
Who are you following?
Key mentioned that you know previously
in other sessions that she's been
reaching out to folks
at her target
companies and asking if they would be
interested in a
coffee chat.
Right.
perfect opportunity for maybe one person
that she's been able to have a coffee
chat with
following that person
and commenting on posts
that they've written,
right? It's good stuff.
And
you can also start brainstorming content
ideas for your first post.
And before you post it, if you're
nervous, you want to reach out to me and
say, "This is what I'd like to post.
What do you think of this?" I'm happy to
review it. Did I trust you? Oh, you know
exactly what you're doing.
Now
in I engagement I want you to really
sit with this as well.
Engagement equals visibility.
Visibility
equals opportunity.
And now why do why do first posts feel
so scary
and how to overcome that?
So
most professionals lurk for months
before postings. But you know what?
Recruiters don't care about perfection.
They care about visibility.
Credibility comes from consist
consistency, not a flawless post.
Let me say that again.
Credibility
comes from consistency,
not a flaw flawless post.
Now,
you know, I'm going to try to copy and
paste this. It didn't work last week.
Let's see if this works.
But this is a little template for you to
follow for your posts. Do you all see
this? Did it come through? Yeah. Cool.
Say yeah your hook line
what you're working on or learning
context why it matters what you learned
or who helped you
who was part of the project that maybe
you posted. Shout them out.
reflection or takeaway
what you do differently or what excited
you about the project. What's excites
you about this article that you just
posted? What excited you about the
podcast that you just listened to that
resonated so deeply with you that you
decided to post it on LinkedIn
and share
why this coding
podcasts
changed things for you
and then ask a question, invite comments
or just share gratitude,
right? Example, this week I built my
first full stack project at Techjoy
Academy.
It challenged me to think about user
flows and debugging in new ways. I
learned that breaking problems into
smaller parts makes solutions faster and
cleaner.
curious how others approach debugging
when they're stuck on code.
Simple, right?
So,
some takeaways here that I'd like for
you to think about.
Posting and commenting show recruiters
you're active,
you're motivated,
and you're industry aware.
You don't have to be an expert.
Not the point. The point is engagement.
The import the importance is networking
and that you're motivated and you're
inspired
and you're engaging collaborating.
Again, network is a mirror. LinkedIn is
a mirror of how you will engage and
behave on the job.
Okay.
and recruiters and hiring leads, they
notice candidates who engage
thoughtfully with industry
conversations. You'll have to do that on
the job, whether you're remote, hybrid,
or on-site.
So,
some strong comment starters. So, when
you want to add value to recruiter or
hiring manager posts, what might that
look like? This aligns with what I've
been seeing in my projects at TechJoy
Academy.
I agree with your point on blank. In my
experience, blank has also been
important.
Thanks for sharing this. I've been
exploring similar approaches in my
coding journey.
this resonates. I learned the same
lesson when working on blank project.
So all of these things are
examples of how you can engage.
So
it's you never not have something
valuable to say. You always have
something valuable to say.
Show recruiters
that you're not a passive job seeker but
an engaged professional.
That's what you all are. Yes, you're
learning something new, but that's what
you're doing. You're learning something
new.
You've most of you have worked for many
years
and you have that realw world
experience.
Be confident in what you bring to the
table.
Be confident of the value that you bring
regardless of your age,
regardless of your pedigree in terms of
education,
regardless of whether you're remote
worker or hybrid worker or on-site.
You are all
incredibly special and you all have
something of value to bring to the
table.
So,
what questions do you have? I don't want
to keep you all, but I will stay later
if you'd like. You just let me know.
What questions do you have?
Is there any thing that I covered that
you'd like to hear
more of? Anything that needs requires
more clarity?
>> When should I start working with you? I
just got into mod 2.
>> Yeah, congrats. That's great.
>> Thanks.
>> That's a great achievement. every step.
Yeah, that's right, Key. Let's give a
little round of applause. That's
awesome, Michelle.
>> Yeah. Yeah,
>> I love that. Love to hear it.
>> Yeah, I worked really hard. I did it as
fast as I could.
>> Yeah. Yeah. And I I know we are all
um
we're all very cognizant of time these
days, right?
And we're all very cognizant of
maybe even a little over
analytical
of
our performance
whether it's in interviews,
Q&A sessions.
And I think that it's very easy to fall
into
a certain mindset,
but it don't don't give up.
Sometimes to
you have to put things down.
>> Yeah.
>> Some some things you have to
you know what?
I'm not going to apply to jobs this
week.
You know what? I'm just gonna observe
on LinkedIn this week. I'm not going to
post anything. I'm not going to comment.
You know what? I'm not going on LinkedIn
at all this week.
That's okay, too.
>> Yeah. I took a little short break once I
got into I pushed really hard. do.
>> Yeah. Yeah. And I think it's also about
knowing your limits
and accepting
where you are in the moment.
I
um same thing same thing I you know
there are many people dealing with a lot
right now.
Um,
>> yeah,
>> it's it's
but we all the the amazing thing about
this community that Dr. Emily has
curated is we all have each other,
right?
>> Yeah, that's
>> Yeah, we might be at different levels.
We might be in different phases.
of the program,
but we're all here.
We all have each other. And you know
what? We might all be at different
levels of the program. We're all going
through the same thing.
That's the common thread.
And the beauty too is that you can
always rewatch some of my sessions
and
you also can reach out to me and be
like, "Hey, can we talk?" And it doesn't
have to be about your resume. Doesn't
have to be about LinkedIn.
It can be. Dang,
I'm having a I'm having a moment.
I'm here for that, too.
>> I'm having moments, too.
>> Yeah.
>> But what I'm excited about
is
the things that I'm working on with Dr.
Emily and brainstorming sort of behind
the scenes and working with Dr. Kristen
is
making sure that we can support you in
the best way possible.
And what is beautiful about TechJoy
Academy is
we take
we take
we take people,
we train them,
we give them real projects in real time
with real clients to work on. already
know how you're going to work and be
successful and behave in the workplace.
That's why we can start rebranding,
talking about what we do more on
LinkedIn, taking the guesswork because
you can interview somebody all you want.
They get on the job, they have to
perform. They have to live up to that
interview.
That's why all of you are so good and
will be so good because we know what you
can do. You've already demonstrated it
in real time with real clients, real
projects.
So, we can now go to people and say,
"Here's Michelle. Let me tell you about
Michelle. Let me tell you about what
she's done.
Look at Hope,
Jazz, Key. These are some of our star
students. They're ready to go.
So, if you haven't
started thinking about shaping up your
resume, if you need help shaping up your
LinkedIn profile, I'm here.
I got you.
and hope. I'm really excited about your
resume. I'm really excited for you to
see your resume.
>> Oh, thank you. Thank you.
>> I think you're gonna be excited
cuz girl, you gave me you you gave me
you gave me threw me a loop. You threw
me cuz you had your professional resume,
but then you had other stuff and I
really had to work on integrating it.
And I'm really I'm I must say that I'm
very proud.
of you.
>> I'm proud with how it it turned out.
>> Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. But you
know,
>> Yeah. What?
>> I I just have one quick question, but I
think a problem I'm having is a
scheduling. you know, I have so much on
my plate that it's hard for me to to to
really and um so I went out and I was
asking AI for different tools that I
could use. Well, one of them was
monday.com. Well, Monday it's okay, but
it's um the free one, you know, they
kind of hook you, you know, you you can
do it for seven days, but that's they're
really giving you like a pro
>> what the pros can do. So, is there any
do you know of any like free
scheduling tools out there that you've
used for um you know kind of like a
that's similar to like a Monday.com or a
>> like a on a board or you know that type
of thing where you could put
>> I don't I mean
>> oh say that who said that
>> is it is it goal oriented
>> yes it is task task orient oriented and
goal oriented.
>> Go to go check out our app that we
built.
We built a goal oriented scheduleuler
uh during the last challenge and it's
called um
it's evening August evening I think it's
called. It's in GitHub. I think it's in
GitHub.
>> Oh, okay.
>> If if you don't I'll try to send it to
you. But we built a scheduleuler with a
goal oriented type of thing. Um,
>> that's pretty cool.
>> Yeah, we did it in four days.
>> But there's one called Priori plant.
>> Any other
I I tried the P puri plant. That one is
really great, but you can only use it
like uh once on Google and then once on
Duck Go Duck and once on um Microsoft
Edge. You can't keep,
>> you know,
>> wonder why that is.
>> And I I don't know. I was going to
actually I probably should take it to
one of the developers and see how I can
make it so that I could keep keep
reusing it. Yeah, because that's that
shouldn't be like that. We're supposed
to but it's on um what what else is it
on? It's on something else, too.
>> Uh I'll I'll send I'll send you
something. Accept my friendship request
and I'll I'll figure out why it isn't
working.
>> Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Michelle.
>> Yeah, because I'd really love to have
somebody use it. I mean, we spent a lot
of time on that
and it should be usable.
>> Okay. Thank I wish I had something more
to offer hope. Um,
but full transparency, I throw
weekly I will say
I will put in chat GBT.
This is these are the tasks.
This is exactly what I want to
accomplish.
This is my schedule. These are my
appointments that I have to make. This
is if I have to drive somewhere, I'll
say this is how much time I need to get.
Um, I'll list everything out and then
chat TBT will just give me a schedule
and they'll offer different ways to time
block and then I'll just add them to my
calendar, my digital calendar. Also, I'm
I'm Gen X. I'm old school. I have to
have my my my

grandparents.
Um my grandmothers, my great aunts. My
grandmother will be 101 in December. She

>> I love I'm such a coupon girl. But like,
you know, it's like I Yes, I have my
digital calendar,
but I have to have my I write everything
down in my book, too,
>> cuz I like to, you know, get my little
stickers, my little coupons, my little
other lists, my receipts, my whatever.
So, yeah, I'm old school.
>> Um,
yeah, but um yeah, that's what I do.
Hope I find that just to be super
helpful and easy. And I I'm still I
still feel like um hanging with the cool
kids
using AI.
>> Yeah.
>> Right. So,
>> okay, Jazz, please make sure that you
message me. I can absolutely help you
and we can work on everything together.
But what I really really want you to do
is take a take a breath, take a beat.

And that is the gift.
So, it's all going to come. It's, you

babe.
You'll get there.
>> It's just it's just I'm taking too much
from my mortgage. You know, all these
>> I know
>> things I do to uh help myself.
Basically, this all helps me to
>> um you know to start well to to adjust
to work.
>> Yeah.
>> Eventually come. Um,
>> you know what, Jazz? God, spirit,
>> whatever you believe.
>> Yeah.
>> It all takes care of itself, right?
Hope.
>> Exactly. Exactly.
>> Right. Hope. That's right. That's right.
She She has a mini whiteboard.
Nice. Uh, keep my You know what? Oh,
it's a little guy. It's actually just
like a 4x6 picture frame with like a
piece of paper that used to be a
notepad. I took the like 4x6 notepad and
just put one in there. And now I just
have it as a dry erase notepad.
>> Boom.
[Music]
There you go. Key.
There you go.
So, everyone go with God. It's all going
to get figured out.
Everything's going to be okay. Jazz,
just everyone message me with what you
need. I'm here to help you.
We're all in this together. So,

and um yeah, come hang out with me
oneon-one if you'd like. I love a good
hang. And I love how this was all the
ladies tonight.
>> Yes. Yeah.

>> I'm gonna go look for that. Yep.
>> Okay.
All right, ladies. Have a beautiful,
beautiful evening and we'll talk soon.
>> All right. Bye.
