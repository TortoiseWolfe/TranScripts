Career Strategy w/ Chelsea - LinkedIn Optimization for Junior Developers
https://youtu.be/3n-waDkVu9o

Hey John, how's it going?
>> Hi. How are you?
>> I'm good. You are in outer space.
>> Yeah, that was
>> I like it.
Yeah, that's one of the few um pre- uh
loaded u backgrounds they had. So, I I
chose it a long time ago and it just
stuck. So,
>> I like it.
>> Some people put their own pictures back
there which look kind of cool depending
on
>> on what they are. So, yeah.
>> Yeah. Yeah.
>> Since I'm meeting with you tomorrow, I
don't really have anything today. I was
just going to drop in and listen in the
background. So,
>> Sure. Yeah, I think uh this is gonna be
a good time.
>> Okay,
>> it's it'll be a party
>> like Katrina's Python party. Have you
seen that name of her?
>> Oh, yeah.
I love it.
All right, we'll just uh we'll wait for
just a couple more seconds to see if a
few others are going to be able to join.
Um, this is the first part or the first
sort of portion of an 18-week session
plan that I've mapped out for focusing
on LinkedIn
um, and your LinkedIn presence. So I'll
probably be you know repeating some
information in the second session as
well just for those who may not have
been able to attend this session. Um and
then for anyone new kind of dropping in.
Um but before I start how's everybody
how's everybody feeling this morning?
Good. Katrina's giving thumbs up.
Stephen, hello. I don't think I think
maybe we were we've been in a few
sessions uh here and there but good to
see you good to meet you again. Um
so here we are.
>> I guess I have a small question now that
you uh mentioned about your two
meetings. Uh like last week I didn't go
to the second
>> I didn't go to the second one like the
later in the evening cuz I thought it
was the same as this. Are you saying
that they're both different kind of
>> or no?
>> Yeah, I it'll be uh the same subject
matter, but uh it'll be more I think of
an open discussion in the second
portion. But because some people may not
be able to make it, I will be reviewing
what I've covered here because there is
a pretty um wide breath of information.
Um and I'm just breaking down starting
from top to bottom uh with LinkedIn. So
it'll be spread across. So um you know
this session is really to help you build
um a strong authentic LinkedIn presence
that supports your job search uh your
goals as junior developers. Um the
session will include you know a little
bit of a mini training followed by you
know coaching and feedback. Uh I won't
be breaking you out into different
rooms. We're a small group. Um but I
will be asking you to do a couple of
things independently today. Uh that will
help you start curating your LinkedIn
profile. Um so each week for both
sessions will include a focused theme uh
mini training session and um live
practice and feedback. So why LinkedIn
matters? So,
this is really to help you understand
why LinkedIn is essential um and how it
plays a unique role in your job search
beyond résumés and applications because
it's not just a platform to kind of you
know post where you've worked and uh
have recruiter pro recruiters post jobs
and you apply to them. LinkedIn and what
it does is is vast, right? So, LinkedIn
is a recruiter's first stop. 95% of
recruiters and hiring managers use it
daily to source talent. It is our
database. Even if you apply through a
job board, uh they'll often check your
check your LinkedIn profile before
reaching out. It serves as your public
resume and reputation all in one all on
one sheet. Um,
so
here's
got some other people coming in.
Um, so here is why a strong LinkedIn
presence increases visibility and
network opportunities.
Hello Kai. Um, so it helps you get
found, right? So LinkedIn is the primary
sourcing tool for recruiters, believe it
or not. So while they're filling a job
now or building a pipeline for future
goals, they're searching by keywords,
skills, job titles, and locations.
Seeing if you are remote, if you are
hybrid, if you are um someone who wants
to come into the office, that is
LinkedIn is a huge source of information
for recruiters.
Now, why it matters? So recruiters use
boolean searches to find candidates. So
they'll type in junior developer and
JavaScript and New York. Those titles,
locations, and program knowledge in
quotes
that allows
us to pull from LinkedIn and search the
database.
Um, a strong profile with the right
keywords,
skills, and summary increases your
chances of showing up in these search
results that recruiters are running in
LinkedIn. That's why it matters. So
having a clear
keywordrich headline
and skill section ensures you're part of
the conversation even when you are not
applying to jobs. This is part of the
beauty of LinkedIn. It helps to do the
work for you if you have set up your
profile properly. Um this is where
personal branding starts. Starts right
here. and personal branding is what sets
you apart from the sea of applicants
that we are seeing in the job market
right now. Um unlike resumes,
LinkedIn allows you to tell your story,
why you got into tech, why you care
about it, and what you're trying to
build. Right? So, it's the first
impression that often sticks.
Okay? So I'll just pause for a moment.
Welcome those who have um hopped on uh a
little behind. Hello everyone. Um we are
talking about LinkedIn today. So, if you
are able to catch my session at 6 PM, it
will be more of an open discussion, but
I will be reviewing some of what I ran
through today in case others are able to
attend my evening session. Um, it will
be an 18week
focused
um focused workshop sessions. So, this
is the first of many. Uh so we'll be
doing a deep dive. Um now what is
personal branding? Right? Personal
branding is how you intentionally
present yourself, your values, your
stories, your skills, and your voice to
others in a professional context.
That's important. and
finding a way to
um
articulate that uniqueness in a LinkedIn
profile is important. So, it's not about
being flashy or overly polished. It's
about being clear, being consistent, and
authentic in how you show up. Okay? So,
LinkedIn is a perfect place to start
that. So, unlike a resume which is
limited to bullet points and rigid
formatting, LinkedIn gives you the space
to explain the why behind the what. It
allows you to connect the dots
between your background and your career
goals. especially for junior developers
or those pivoting into a different
career. Okay?
So, it's where your story lives.
So,
start from the beginning, your about
section. It isn't a summary of your
resume. No, it's a snapshot of who you
are, why you made the leap into tech,
what drives you,
and where you're headed. This is where
your voice
and knowing yourself and being confident
in yourself and your skill set, this is
when it matters. So an example,
see
after five years in healthcare
administration,
I discovered coding through a free
online course and was immediately
hooked. I'm now building responsive
front-end projects with React and
constantly looking for ways to blend
design and functionality.
an example.
I would build on that. I think that's a
great start for an about section.
Um, a little bit more meat.
Uh, let's see. Okay.
Uh, yes. And I believe this session is
being recorded.
Yeah, keep me honest, Katrina. Okay,
good.
It looks like it's recording. Good. Um,
so
why should you care about LinkedIn and
these about sections and these little
pieces within telling this story, right?
Hiring managers and recruiters want to
feel something when they visit your
profile. They want to engage. They're
not just looking at what you can do.
They're thinking,
"Does this person seem motivated?"
Um, are their goals clear?
Are you someone they'd enjoy working
with?
I mean, in the resume, you can, it's
like very regimented and very like this
is what I've done. LinkedIn, you can
actually oftentimes have a little bit of
fun. It's not just about what you can
bring to the table from a hard and soft
skills perspective
like
you know what what else about you is
exciting. Do you love to cook? Are you a
musician? Do you like long walks and
traveling? You know those things. Um, a
thoughtful summary also um helps
recruiters connect with you on a human
level, which there is an element of
that. You want to know that the person
that you're reaching out to is going to
have some sort of gravitas, right?
Because, you know, even as a coder,
you're not just or a remote uh worker
coder.
Yes, you'll be sitting behind a screen,
but you're going to be interacting with
hiring leads. You will also be
interacting with talent just like
yourself.
Someday you're going to be interviewing
people. You're going to be interviewing
junior developers to join your team. So,
this is all a part of the process.
You're not just a coder sitting in a box
not being disturbed. No, we want to hear
a coder's perspective from beginning to
end of a project.
Um, you know, a a thoughtful summary,
like I said, helps recruiters connect
with you on a human level and it sets
the tone for everything else. So once
you nail your voice and message in the
summary and headline,
it helps to guide your tone for your
portfolio site if you choose to have one
in addition to GitHub.
Cover letters, what you post or share on
LinkedIn, how you introduce yourself in
interviews. Your personal brand should
feel cohesive across all platforms.
Um, in advertising,
what used to drive me nuts as a
recruiter is hiring teams to work on a
new brand. And they would be working
across all disciplines, print, out of
home, radio, TV, and then of course, you
know, the gamut of digital um projects
from could be platforms to banner ads to
social media content.
What used to drive me nuts is when one
campaign,
one 360 campaign
looked like it was produced by different
agencies because no one spoke to each
other. It wasn't cohesive. So, think of
your brand as an ad.
Has to be cohesive
and look like
it's coming from the same person.
regardless of what the platform is.
Any questions, thoughts, or concerns so
far?
Okay. All right. I'm going to continue.
If you would like me to slow down, I can
absolutely do so. Just let me know. Now,
what um somebody say something
I I have just one. So the the co the
cohesion,
>> is this something that you start off
with sort of having sort of a like
identifying how you want to sort of
format things or is this something that
you sort of come to a conclusion once
you've looked at everything?
>> Nothing, you know what? Nothing is ever
final. And I tell this to artists, any
kind of creative, musicians, theater
people, dancers, hair stylists,
chefs,
your brand is never finished and it
always evolves. It's finished when
you're in the ground and even then then
that shifts to legacy, right? So,
I always feel like
creating your LinkedIn brand
and starting with that makes a little
bit of sense to me, especially for those
individuals who, you know what, I got to
get working. I have a family. I have
kids. I'm the main supporter of my
family. Got to make sure that I get a
job. LinkedIn is that visibility and
it's that immediate visibility. And as I
said, if you've structured it properly
and you have your skills and everything
is clear, then
you will be people will recruiters will
search profiles based on boolean
searches or however they run their
searches and you will come up if your
skills are there. So you want to have
visibility like immediate visibility and
I just feel like LinkedIn is the is the
quickest way to do that.
Did I answer
that? Okay.
>> Uh yeah, it I mean it sounds like start
with LinkedIn.
>> Yeah. Yeah, I think so. It's I mean you
can start wherever you want but
regardless it's going to evolve a a as
as you continue to move into your career
and work at different places and pick
things different things up. You'll want
to highlight various hard and soft
skills that you're picking up along the
way, but also
your preferences and you know um your
management style. all of those things
will come into play. Um,
so let me ask all of you a question and
and we're here's our first little
activity. Uh, if someone only saw your
LinkedIn for 30 seconds, right?
What three things would you want them to
walk away knowing about you?
So think about this for a moment. Write
three points down
and those three points
can become the framework for your
headline and summary.
So take a let's take a few minutes.
Doesn't have to be long sentences or
paragraphs. This is just kind of like
the spitball
in advertising. We call it the war room
where we're sitting around a table
spitballing ideas.
Would
anyone like to share one or all of their
points?
Anyone?
Should I pick someone? Kai, you're on my
screen. Do you mind if I choose you?
Sure.
Um, still still writing them, but just
sort of three like key items. Uh, fast
learner, competent, trustworthy.
I don't know if that's
>> tremendous
>> development.
>> Tremendous. Yeah. And it it doesn't have
to I mean, this is just the beginning,
right? We're just
>> we're just ideiating. I love that. Thank
you. Anyone else? John, come on. John,
we're talking you. It's you and I all
day today.
>> Yeah. So, I was work I was working on
it. So, like the first one obviously
would just be like what I'm actually
like in, you know, interested in doing
what like I've been building towards
would just be, you know, like being a
web developer and maybe being a little
more specific about that.
Um, so yeah, I I'm I'm not totally sure
about uh presenting this stuff, but I'm,
you know, you brought up a new idea for
me. So, um, it's very important for me.
The atmosphere that I would be working
in, the environment is just as important
to me as the actual job itself.
>> Um, and% whether I whether it's remote
or hybrid or going in there, you know, I
I I can do any of those. the be the
going into office would be if it was um
you know where I live now because I
would not re relocate you know
>> sure
>> but I would want to maybe make some sort
of reference to that about uh because I
think people can relate to that too um
about like wanting to be comfortable in
>> um I have developed my own little game
which I have on uh on LinkedIn but you
know I might make more reference to that
um but I would also so I that's already
three but like one more I I would want
to share something about more about
myself that's not related to the coding
at all um some sort of hobby or
something
um which
>> I've had many but ne none of them like
very like very serious you like kind of
like a jack of all trades but a master
at none so it's like well which one like
what what would I Um, I may I may put
something about like running because
that's what I've done a lot of and I
know like it it's a it's a positive
thing that uh people look at. Um,
>> so I I don't know. I would I would pick
out something like that that uh
>> to like you said to have people know you
on a more of a human level or something.
So
>> yeah. Yeah. Stephen, what about you? Do
you have uh any thoughts that you can
that you'd be willing to throw out for
us?
>> Well, I think that I would like anybody
that looks at my resume or my LinkedIn
profile rather,
>> yeah,
>> to know what I've that I've been coding
for the past two years, a little over
two years, and the different
>> uh technologies that I've learned
especially in this uh coding boot camp
or academy. Okay.
>> Um because I also have experience from
another coding boot camp before this one
and it was a little bit different too.
Um and I guess the
um I guess I would like them to see the
what I worked on in the past 15 years
that was nonrelated to tech because I
kind of would like to find somewhere or
maybe take those skills or have somebody
value those skills,
>> transferable skills. Yeah.
>> Correct. Right. And ultimately what I
aspire to be, you know, as a um a
backend or front-end web developer.
>> Okay. Okay. So, really focusing on your
your hard skills, your background and
experience even not related to tech. Um
as you feel some of those maybe hard and
soft skills will uh support this next
move.
All right. Um, I'm going to continue if
that's okay with anyone. Does anyone
have any questions? Good. Okay. Um, so
visibility
equals opportunities.
Let's let's shake it out and let's say
that again. that really resonated for me
when I first
started crafting this uh this workshop.
Visibility equals opportunities.
Okay, you show up in a search result
when recruiters look for skills
JavaScript,
HTML, Python.
So, making sure that those skills are
listed. doesn't even have to be
programming languages, but
mentoring,
uh, food and beverage, like these skills
are everything. Maybe you maybe you're a
full stack developer that that has
previous experience at a fintech company
and you love fintech, but you've been
doing it for so many years, you really
want to shift over to biotech. same reg
regulative type of industry,
same similar tech type of industry, but
we want to know that you're able to
shift and that you have some of that
regulatory
and coding experience.
The more complete and optimized your
profile is, the more that you will
appear. You can literally control
what and how often recruiters see
of your profile.
So like
put it to you this way, recruiters use
LinkedIn like Google.
It's the very it's it's a search engine
for us. Recruiters don't just browse job
boards. You know, we search LinkedIn
using the boolean strings and keywords
that I had mentioned in the beginning.
You know, they type
June in quotes junior front end
developer
capital O R for or and then
quotes React developer
capital and JavaScript script capital
and New York. So these are the and and
we plug in some of these boolean
searches in web browsers as well. and
you'll come up if
um everything is structured properly.
Yes. Katrina,
>> is there a way to test our searchability
that way? Like how can we search for
ourselves to make sure that we are
showing up uh towards the top of those
types of results?
>> Yeah, in LinkedIn you can do searches.
Now sometimes it the ability to see the
a breadth of uh LinkedIn users is based
on whether you are you know a regular
LinkedIn user whether you're pre uh
paying for their premium
package or if you've got LinkedIn easy
LinkedIn
uh re LinkedIn easy will move you over
to um LinkedIn recruiter which is a
whole other way of sourcing. Then you
have LinkedIn recruiter business. So
yes, you can you can search uh do
bullying searches within LinkedIn in the
search bar. Um but depending on what
package you've bought into for LinkedIn
will really
tell the tale on how many people uh will
show up and also if you show up as well.
So,
I hope I answered your question. Yeah.
Also, um if your profile contains
specific keywords and skills and it's
complete, you will appear in um in
search results. If your LinkedIn profile
is incomplete, then you won't really
show up. Um, the most important sections
for search visibility,
the headline,
the about or summary section,
experience, and skills. Each of these
should naturally include terms like
career changer,
git, accessibility,
JavaScript, HTML, front-end developer,
software engineer, full stack developer.
You can add those skills in each job
that you list.
Now, LinkedIn literally rewards profile
completeness. So, if your profile is
marked allstar,
you're more likely to rank higher in
recruiter searches.
um you look more like a trusted
uh credible candidate because you have a
shield when you are linking that company
to your
um work experience. Yes, John.
Uh when you say allstar, is that
something that they mark you as based on
your profile completeness or are you
saying like somebody who puts that in
there?
>> Okay. That they
>> Well, it's it's Yeah, it's based on
profile completeness. Um if everything
you can uh add it, but you have to have
your profile complete.
the, you know, you need to have your
headline, your photo,
skills listed, some recommendations.
It needs to be something that is robust
and they'll give you that option to add
it yourself.
>> And when you mention,
>> sorry,
>> when you mention career,
>> when you mention career changer, um, is
that something like would anybody ever
actually search for that? Is that like a
good thing?
>> Yes,
>> it can be. Um, it's it's not good or
bad. It's, you know, sometimes as a
recruiter, I've looked for fresh faces.
>> Okay. I've looked for
people that
maybe were on the account side
and they shift into copywriting
in their career
or they're
this this has happened to me a lot
actually in healthcare advertising
recruitment.
um doctors
who become healthc care pharmaceutical
writers.
>> Yeah. because they're just I that that
happened a lot during COVID. Um I was
identifying a lot of um PhDs within
science and medicine and biotech who
were looking to get out and do something
that was a little less stressful. And
>> my brother
>> Yeah, my brother's an ER doctor and he
just kind of switched over. Well, one of
his jobs now is like in insurance kind
of. So yeah.
>> Yeah. Yeah. It's Yeah. And people change
careers all the time for different
reasons and it it's a uh a fact of life.
It is not, you know, good nor bad. It it
just is.
Um thank you for that question, John. I
appreciate it. But you know what makes a
profile allstar, right? John, you just,
you know, asked this photo, headline,
the summary or about section, two plus
work experiences listed, listing one.
And and I understand that there's
apprehension like, oh no, I was a bus
driver before I became a coder. It's all
right. List it. People work. People have
lives. No big deal.
What I wouldn't list is, you know, if
you're uh a a school, you know, if you
just graduated and you were bartending
at
Hooters, maybe not list it.
Just saying.
Um,
the activity
that you have through LinkedIn, believe
it or not, also boosts your visibility.
commenting on posts by others in tech,
like those that you're really excited
about, that you admire within the tech
industry.
Connect with them, research their work,
shoot them a quick note,
tell them, you know, I'm really inspired
by your work, and this is actually a
specific project that really inspired
me. I'm so interested in your company.
Here's here's a little bit about me.
Here's my resume.
Even at companies that are not hiring
right now, recruiters that are not
hiring, connect with them.
Shoot them a quick note.
reacting to alumni or recruiter updates,
sharing progress on your latest boot
camp project on LinkedIn, right? Post
once a month with a career or learning
update. Let people know, hey, I am so
excited about TechJoy. This is an
amazing program. I'm learning so much,
great people,
great coaches,
great curriculum,
and you know, this not only brings more
people into Techjoy, but it lets people
know that you're doing the work,
that yeah, you know, uh they have a a
job, a whole family, but they're they're
getting it in.
So, you know, be proud of your
achievements and what you're doing and
and talk about it on LinkedIn. It makes
you visible. It increases your
visibility in your network speed and
recruiters are watching. It's like, I
didn't even apply for this role, but a
recruiter found me on LinkedIn. That's
the goal. And when I recruit,
the last thing I will look at
are who applied. I'm always going I'm
I'm going out and looking for the talent
that I need at the agencies or
organizations that are doing the work
that I love.
And most often when I'm talking to the
hiring manager about what they're
looking for, one of my questions, and
all of you should know this because
again, you all are going to be hiring
managers one day and a recruiter is
going to come to you and say, "Oh, you
need a couple software engineers. Oh,
you need a couple junior developers.
Cool. Where where do you want me to
look? What companies excite you? Where
is the work coming out that you are just
blown away from? Like what what what
technologies are some of these companies
using that you think some of the the
pedigree of the talent that they have in
their employee pool?
Yeah. What is it that excites you about
them?
That's helpful to a recruiter. Help me
help you. What do you want? Who do you
like?
Where are they?
And then I go in
and I pull them out.
So profiles don't get opportunities.
People with presence do. So remember
that one, too.
And you can
put that
authenticity into your LinkedIn profile
and allow that profile to be a
representation of you.
You know, even if you're not applying to
jobs yet,
visibility builds trust and recognition
before you need it.
Any
questions before we do our next
activity?
No. Okay.
So, I'd love you guys to
choose
two to three roles
that you want.
And this is likely a little bit of
homework.
So nothing to do right now, but we can
talk about it. And if all of you are
able to
meet in the evening,
I will touch on this piece.
So choose two to three roles that you
want.
Then search for those roles on LinkedIn.
Read three job descriptions
and highlight repeated keywords
and then go and check your profile for
those terms.
Are they there?
Let me
do I'm gonna put this in the chat.
>> Quick question. Do you mean three
>> three roles with different companies or
three different types of jobs? For
example, QA, junior dev, and then full.
>> Okay.
>> What titles do you want? What jobs do
you want? They might have all of those
openings at say Amazon,
but I would say maybe not to limit
yourself
and like
just go for it.
Uh,
okay. I'm just trying to get this in the
chat for you guys
and then you can think about it because
it's a nice little exercise just to also
see how your profile matches with job
descriptions because that's what we want
to do. We want to make sure that that
ATS because as some of you may know if
you're applying to jobs sometimes you
can apply through LinkedIn.
So, there's a few different ways to do
it. Either way, the applicant tracking
system
there.
They're going to pick it up and you want
it to.
Okay.
All right. So, there's a little
homework. Now,
network.
Your network is very powerful.
Right.
Connections matter. And I will likely do
a whole other
couple of week workshops on this. I've
gotten pretty much every position
except for my first recruiting job from
people that I knew and worked with.
Relationships, relationships,
relationships. And uh what I've had
happen to me is a couple people that I
hired as juniors, they became executive
creative directors and they hired me. So
it's a give and take, right? So
70 to 85% of roles are filled through
networking.
LinkedIn gives you a builtin
professional community and job search
tool. So engaging with people
and you know allows you you to be top of
mind
for hiring managers for other employees
at other agencies. Now this is a thing I
would say every agency, every corporate
company,
every you know medical, healthc care,
any organization in this country has
something called employee referral
benefit.
That's right. If you work at a company
and there are openings
in order to bring in top talent that
maybe current employees have worked
with, they will give their internal
talent anywhere from I've seen it as low
as $200 upward to $10,000
for referrals.
So that is also part of the relationship
building that happens internally.
Companies much rather
hire people that other internal
employees know, have worked with, and
have had success with. So keep that in
mind as well. It's not just about who
you know, though. It's also about who
knows you and thinks of you when
opportunities arise.
Um, the people you've worked with,
learned from, commented on, messaged, or
even connected with, they're the ones
who open doors.
people that you work with here in
TechJoy, which is why it's so important
to show up in this space with your
camera positive, ready to go, engaged,
locked in, because you know, Katrina
could leave TechJoy and get a really
badass position as like a VP director.
I've only worked with her a few times.
She's there. I'm a recruiter. I'm
already thinking about where am I going
to put her cuz she's there.
But she gets into a role and she's just
like, "Oh, damn. You know what? We've
got three openings
for this, this, and that." And you know
what? I've got a QA role that's going to
do a lot of coding and developing, and
Mindy would be great for that. that can
be a remote role like you know it's then
then because why wouldn't Katrina want
to build a team beneath her with people
she knows and loves and knows will will
kill the work
that happens
many roles are never posted publicly
either that's the truth they're shared
through internal referrals or
recommendations
so so much of what you see
isn't even the breath of what is really
open.
You know, even when applying online, a
referral gives you four times higher
chances of getting an interview.
That's why starting to connect with
these people that you don't even know.
As a recruiter, I've had to do that all
the time. And I'm wooing talent from a
lot of these agencies with CCOs who want
awarded. I want everyone to be awarded.
Great.
How am I going to
get the attention of this amazing
creative or amazing developer or
incredible production uh or producer
and woo them from this incredible
company that they're at now?
know their work, send a message. Like,
wouldn't it be amazing if a recruiter
reached out to you and said, "Damn, you
killed that platform." I imagine that
code was so killer on the back end. It
was so fluid. Moving through that site
was incredible. Really, really love your
work.
Wouldn't that be like, "Oh, who's this?"
She said she loved my work. She knows my
work. She talked about key elements.
So, you know, do a little bit of
research, know your stuff about these
people that you're reaching out, make it
meaningful,
throw it in chat GBT or whatever AI
platform you use to tighten up the
language. But yeah, you know,
reconnect with people from your past
career.
Engage with fellow developers, mentors,
instructors.
Introduce yourself to recruiters or
hiring managers directly. Like I've been
saying, get recommended.
Reach out to some of the people that you
worked with in the past. Even if it's
not development focused, it's okay.
this. I've worked with the I'd worked
I've worked with John in the past. He's
awesome. Oh, yeah. John was my boss for
a couple of years. He mentored me, made
he made me who I am today.
That's that's what we're looking for. Um
v visibility builds trust over time,
right? So networking does not mean
begging for a job.
It means staying visible
in in the way that you know and that
adds value. So when the right
opportunity pops up, someone thinks of
you
commenting this is a great reminder or
I've been applying these you know JS
principles in my latest project.
Start getting a little bit active on
LinkedIn.
And now we are
we've got a little over 10 minutes.
Would you like to ask questions now or
would you like me to continue moving
through some of the rest of the
material? Yes, John.
>> Uh I'll ask a quick question. Um, so
some of the messages we get from um,
recruiters on LinkedIn, like I don't
think that they're real recruit Well,
let's put it this way, they're the ones
that get paid for, well, not just
bringing in clients, but like um, like I
don't think it's one of those deals
where you pay them to try to find you a
job and I just feel like they're more
like scam like, you know, so
>> I get a lot of those, too.
>> Yeah. So, I basically just stopped even
like responding to any of them because I
only responded to like two and I
realized what they were and I was like,
"Well,
>> so like is there a way of filtering like
do you have to go through every one of
those to try to or like is there a way
of like filtering out to find like a
real
>> like I doubt I've even been messaged by
a real recruiter yet. I mean, one that
you wouldn't have to pay for.
>> Yeah. Um it's you have to use your own
discern discernment for sure. I mean I
get those I get those emails too. We we
we all are going to um you know I think
it's just about you know being smart
which is why I always emphasize being
proactive in who you're reaching out to
and making sure that you know you kind
of ha are building your own database
within LinkedIn that is a curation and
of who you are trying to target and
connect with.
So, you're building your own orbit.
>> Yeah. And just going along with that,
that's was my next question. A lot of
the connection requests, like at first I
was trying to vet them and then I just
started being like I just check check
like I'm like, "Well, it can't hurt me,
but maybe it can. I don't know." Like
like if you're getting like fake people
or like I don't know. You know what I'm
mean? You know what I mean? Like is it
okay to just accept?
You can accept and decline whatever you
want. And what I typically do is
whenever I get a message, either an
direct email or a LinkedIn message, I'll
go to their profile straight away. And
if their profile picture looks like
heavily AI
and they're in like some other country
that I have no idea, chances are it's
not something I want to engage in
because I need something that is like on
the ground here in the US in real time.
>> Yeah. And so I also thought, well, it's
bringing in those people to my
connections like, you know, it's kind of
diluting real people or whatever. So, I
was like, maybe I should be more
discerning about the connections that I
just accept or whatever.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. I mean, you can accept people, but
then you can, you know, just choose to
ignore them if you're unsure.
>> Yeah, that's true. Okay. Thank you.
>> So,
network networking isn't, you know, one
big ask. It's lots of small touch
points.
>> Mhm. So
it's it's not one big grand gesture.
It's a habit, right? So when you're
building your relationships without
asking for anything, it's like, you
know, share helpful content with a short
reflection,
DM someone with a thank you after
attending a webinar or reading their
blog,
like little things like that.
Um
I the biggest takeaway
is your LinkedIn profile grows with you.
It is a never-ending open-ended project
that highlights who you are,
where you've been,
and
where you're focused on on shifting to,
if you are at all. Um
it's
your profile is never ever done. So show
your don't be shy about showing your
progression and share what you're
learning and stay active.
So I'll be running through everything
that I went through again in a condensed
way.
and my my second session at 6 PM.
Um, and that will be we'll be running
through what makes a great LinkedIn
profile. So, it'll be very much a
collaborative discussion.
Um, that helps
you to start thinking critically about
what works on LinkedIn and why.
You know, like what's the first thing
you notice in a LinkedIn profile?
Anything. Like, have you seen a profile
that really impressed you? What made it
stand out?
What do you want someone to feel when
they land on your profile?
What feels confusing or or unclear about
LinkedIn now?
So, those are some of the topics I will
be covering. Yes, Mindy.
>> I was just looking at LinkedIn. I
haven't really taken a deep dive on it
recently, and basically, it's asking me
to update my about section. It has a um
it has a section for
uh career gaps and I hadn't seen that
before
>> and basically it gives me an opportunity
it so
how can I put this
>> the project ended but then
my mother-in-law was ill and I started
helping her and I kind of put it down as
bereavement and that type of stuff. But
I don't know that shouldn't be a bad
thing because it's almost been two year.
Well, actually it's it's been about two
years since that happened. So there you
go. It
>> Yeah, it's not a bad thing. And and I
think that a lot
changed in
how
how we work.
when CO
happened and I think a lot of us learned
that we all have lives, things happen.
And some people talk about career
changing or pausing careers sbaticals
because they're traveling and they
needed a a mental,
you know, they they needed to take a
mental health month or a year. I think
it's it's much more acceptable and and
or it's much more accepting I think
these days than they have ever been
before
and you can find a clever way. Yeah.
Yeah. find a clever way to talk about
that
both in LinkedIn and resume and and also
in uh my evening session. I will put up
my LinkedIn profile to show you
how I have mine structured. Less
>> less is more.
>> And I'm just taking the the headline
from the banner to the profile pick to
the title. If you want to list pronouns,
if you do not want to list pronouns, I
highly recommend in the uh top portion
that you add your GitHub link that you
add if you have a a some sort of a
creative or personal website. Maybe
you're a poet, maybe you're a long form
writer, maybe you write fiction, maybe
you're a painter.
Throw it up.
I recruiters love to see it.
Love to see it. Maybe you're a
scientist. Maybe you published medical
articles.
Maybe you're in a book club and you want
to highlight something like that. Maybe
you're a dancer, a musician.
Make sure um
be by being clever, Kai. I mean how you
are presenting
information,
you know, maybe you have a a maybe
you're a comedian and nobody knows it.
Maybe the way you choose your words will
not say, you know, bereiement, but maybe
you're coming up with a a snappier
way of saying it. You can do that. You
can be clever, creative.
Right.
Two
two more minutes, guys. I didn't think I
was going to get all of this in this one
session.
Did all of you find this helpful
in the way that I presented this
information?
>> It It's good. I I was just going to say
that basically I took some time to look
at it and that was really important
because I haven't gone there and really
done a deep dive on a lot of things for
a while. So
>> yeah,
>> gives me that opportunity.
>> Cool.
Anyone else? John, I see you ticked your
mic off. Yeah.
>> Yeah. I thought it was a Well,
definitely it was a great improvement
from even the first time that you
talked. Not that that was bad, but like
you could tell you've really No, you
could tell you've really got the format
down. And then I really uh appreciate
the uh stopping like like every fourth
of the way through to ask if anybody has
any questions because otherwise it
becomes like irrelevant almost by the
time you get or you forget or something
like that. So
>> yeah, that was helpful for me. Yeah.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Um would all of you do me a
quick favor just because um names and
ways of of reaching out I don't always
know. I would love to send all of you a
little cheat sheet of what I just ran
through.
Can you just quickly put your email
addresses
in the chat and I'll send you some notes
because I know that this is a lot and
you know you're trying you're sitting
here captivated hopefully trying to
capture all of this information in your
brain and if you're taking notes however
you're taking them um and you know none
of this
>> Yeah.
>> Okay. So, I mean, I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to cut you off. Um, so as looking
through the LinkedIn profile, my
LinkedIn profile,
>> I remember that I listed my education,
my previous coding boot camp and the
current Joy Coding Academy, right? But I
don't seem it doesn't seem like they
register as businesses. So, there's not
a logo that shows up for it.
>> Okay.
Do you know if that's something that
like that LinkedIn controls or is that
something that I did wrong or is that
something that
>> No, no, it's it's it's it they might not
be listed as an official organization in
LinkedIn.
>> So,
>> what's that?
>> The Joy Coding is not listed as an
official business organization. Is that
what you mean?
>> No, Joy, it is. Yeah, it is though. I
have it list. I have it in mine. If you
looked looked at look at my LinkedIn
profile, it's there.
>> Um,
>> what's that?
>> How do I find you on LinkedIn?
>> Hold on one second.
>> Send you I'll send you my profile.
So, anyone who has to drop can let me
just send my LinkedIn uh profile link.
Sorry, my laptop is a little sleepy.
Yeah. And you can all take a look at
this and see how I've listed everything
out because again, keywords, keywords,
keywords.
All right.
Here
we are. Sorry, guys.
There we go.
>> I appreciate that.
>> Of course. Of course. And of course,
ping me um ping me on Discord
if you
need anything, have any questions.
Screenshot. I will forward
um notes around all of this
to you and of course ping me if you have
any questions.
Sound good?
>> Yes.
>> Thank you everyone. Uh hopefully I will
see you uh this evening and we can run
through it'll be a little review or
something new.
>> Thank you. I appreciate your time. This
this was a really good session.
>> Excellent. Thank you so much. Have a
great afternoon. I'll see some of you
later. John, you and I, brother.
>> Have a good afternoon.
