Career Strategy w/ Chelsea - Networking Part 2: Nurturing Relationships
https://youtu.be/wIUsftY2Vfw

Hello everyone.
>> Hello. Look who I have.
>> It's Piper. Look at that sweet girl.
Oh my goodness.
>> I was going to tell you the other times
you asked for her. She was at my
parents' place. She stays half the time
with my parents. Like if I'm not going
to be around.
>> Okay.
>> So sometimes I can't deliver.
>> I made sure I had her for you this time
though.
>> A+ A+ today. A+. Thank you.
She is just beautiful.
All right, folks. I truly apologize for
reasons beyond my control. The uh uh Joy
of Coding staff meeting was happening.
So they went over but here we are. I am
going to dive in. We've got a really
cool session today and this is where
this is where the this is where the
goodness
is going to happen. This is where we
really start to drill down uh our uh it
was kind of like our part two to
networking. So let's take a very quick
recap journey. Look at all these
fabulous faces. And Piper is ready to
go. So, welcome back. Look alive team.
Week one, we covered why LinkedIn
matters, its role in the job hunt. Week
two, we looked at our profile basics
from photo, headline, banner, contact
information, and headline curation. Look
at us go. We are killing it.
Week three, we crafted a compelling
summary.
Week four, we learned how to showcase
our skills, projects, and education.
Week five, we crafted our custom
URL and contact settings.
Last week was our networking part one,
excuse me. who to contact or who to
connect with and how to personalize
invites. Session B draft uh we we
drafted and we sent some real connection
requests. At least that was your
homework. Hopefully hopefully Piper did
hers as well. Um I did
>> heard she was I heard she was more of a
low code gal,
>> but I'm just saying. I'm just saying.
Um,
>> so basically we've already built your
storefront and made initial connections.
Now the real power comes in from
nurturing those connections
into lasting relationships. Right? So
today our two focus areas are session A.
This session we are going to talk about
keeping relationships warm without being
transactional.
And again I will continue to drill this
concept in.
This is where the goodness is
connections networking. This is larger
part
of landing this six-f figureure job
landing the interview.
This is how you do it. Yes, the
application matters because even if you
don't fill out an application upfront,
say that you are a referral and a
recruiter reaches out to you, say they
found you on LinkedIn and a recruiter
reaches out to you, they'll still send
you a link to apply and they have to do
that because they use ATS systems that
generate your offer letter. So they need
all of your information in that
applicant tracking system because then
if you are hired
that information gets transferred over
to the HR IS
system that is connected to payroll that
is connected to uploading your
government IDs.
Okay. F is everyone following?
Yeah. Okay. So
session B later on this evening we will
learn about showing up authentically
through comments repost and consistent
presence. This is where we are going to
start doing some roleplaying and this
will be important because we will take
different scenarios
and how to approach your network based
on these different scenarios. how to
create these templates so that with each
contact you're not reinventing the wheel
and taking time like uh I've got to
write another introduction to who I am
uh I've got to do this uh automate it
get your templates boom boom boom so
number one
we are going to talk about
sending your uh e your
initial network link, right? Your
initial message.
Um, and how to frame it. Um, and the
principles of relationship nurturing.
So,
here's an a an idea that I'd like to you
to think about. So, we often think we
often think networking is about getting
a job or asking for something, but the
strongest networks
come from relationships that feel
natural and human
and mutually supportive.
So, you know, let's see what let's see.
I have templates for connection request
messages and asking for a coffee chat.
Boom. key. There you go. Starting to
nurture that relationship. Starting to
talk about them, not about you.
That's important.
People love to talk about themselves.
They absolutely love to talk about
themselves.
Welcome Leo. Thanks for joining.
So approaching
people in a way that is more about
getting to know them, getting to know
the job that they do, the contribution
they make to a company that you are
eager to get involved in. Not just for a
job. You want a job, you want a job bad,
but
it's it's about showing an interest
rather than
I need a job. So, let's start changing
our mental and start thinking about
approaching folks to learn more about
them. And through there and that avenue
you're building a relationship so that
you can say then say or they can then
say to you John you know I thought of
you we have this really cool software
development position open and you
mentioned you were a full stack
developer right you should check this
out so they're now coming to you now you
have a dialogue
so
when you think of networking
what feeling things come up. So this is
a question for all of you. Are is there
an excitement around networking
pressure awkwardness?
Does anyone want to share how you how
you feel when you think about networking
with folks?
Anybody?
Yes. Key.
>> Um I think a lot of times it feels like
screaming at a brick wall because some
people like just don't respond. Like I
you've seen my connection requests like
half of them are just never gotten a
response, you know, and it's it's
so funny cuz on the other side I've had
several especially in the last few weeks
that have been so helpful. They're like,
"I'm so sorry I was like a day later
than what you were requested. Like
here's my answers to questions because I
can't do a coffee chat, but here's like
all these answers and my insights." So,
like I get this weird mix of like
complete ghosting versus so engaged and
happy to help a new developer.
>> And it's so weird to have that in the
same like
>> 10 people like you've got split 50/50
almost.
>> That's so cool. Hope I'm going to get to
you in one more moment. key
with the folks that you are able to
connect with that have been responsive.
Are you then making sure you're
following them, you're connected with
them, and then following some of their
posts and interacting with some of those
posts if they've been posting?
>> Yeah, a handful of them they don't post
very much. Um, but I have been, um, one
person that I recently had a great
coffee chat with actually was like,
"Well, I don't use LinkedIn a lot, but I
use Twitter." And he ended up giving me
like 10 or 15 um, like names of like,
"Here's who I follow and get my
information from." And so I went, "All
right, maybe I'm going to make a Twitter
account again like just to follow these
people."
>> Amazing.
>> And, you know, he gave me book
recommendations. He was amazing in that
like he was like I love and he gave me
insight into like the industry that he
worked for as a developer which made me
went I don't want to be in that
industry.
>> So like as much as I was like okay cool
I'm glad I know that I don't care about
getting the job at that company because
I don't want to be in the industry he's
working in. Yeah.
>> But he had great like information as far
as like even just a general developer.
>> Um so that was awesome.
I love that. Thank you for sharing that
hope.
>> Well, when you said what what what do I
think about networking? I think about I
don't have a problem with networking
face to face with people. I go up to
them. I I can easily walk up to people
all day long, shake my hand, shake their
hand, ask them, you know, they introduce
myself,
say, "I'm I was really uh inspired by
your talk, but
>> Yeah.
>> online, it's another thing."
>> Yeah. It's another thing.
>> Right. Right. Right. Right. So, it's a
challenge to get past that,
>> you know? You You don't But here's the
thing. You don't have to wait until you
need something to reach out. That's what
makes things feel transactional. And I
think that's sort of a part of, you
know, it's changing the mindset of only
reaching out to people when they have a
job opening. I'm guilty of it of the
same thing as a recruiter, not reaching
out to people until I want to hire them
for a specific specific job. It's about
keeping track of your connections,
congratulating them on a promotion,
um congratulating them on uh or
acknowledging when they've posted an
article that really provided meaning for
you. So that is and I'm happy that you
stepped forward and talked about this
hope because it is oftent times easier
for people sometimes to reach out to
people in person like when you're at
some sort of a career fair or you know a
cocktail hour at um you know some sort
of engagement. Um, so that is how we're
going to
provide you with different scenarios
between these two sessions that will
allow you to brainstorm and and kind of
spitball ideas on templates to use for
different scenarios. So that that was a
great opener. Thank you very much. Hope
Alyssa
I'm like kind of the opposite where I
avoid connection at all costs. I'm just
I don't like reaching out to people. I'm
really shy. I have like three friends
that I talk to. It's it's just so like
not my personality at all. I you I guess
you could say it's transactional because
it's like, well, yeah, you you need
someone. I I'm your guy. I can do it,
right? And like weird because it's the
opposite with the interns. I have no
problems reaching out to my colleagues
but like stranger I don't know maybe
it's like a stranger danger thing I
don't know
>> stranger danger
yeah well again we are in an effort to
make things seamless
uh quick and painless right we'll start
automating some responses and then you
know you can play around with these
templates depending on the scenario So
there, believe it or not, there are
principles to relationship nurturing.
So consistency,
think of it like watering a plant,
right? If you only water your plant once
a year, it dies, right? But small
check-ins every few months,
that's what keeps the connection alive.
So, consistency, right? And you know
what? You don't have to overwhelm
yourself
and say, you know, every single
connection I make, I'm going to send an
email. I mean, you can, but if this is a
pain point for you and a hurdle for you,
let's let's not put pressure on
ourselves. It's ridiculous. All of you
are working very hard, right? You're
getting through this program. You're
focusing on the technical is interview.
You're focusing on some pretty heavy
duty projects. Like, you're already in
it. So, that's also something I would
really love all of you to
bring some consistency into your life.
The consistency of give yourself a
little grace. Okay,
this this is a moment.
We're in a hard moment, but this is the
long game. This relationship building,
I can guarantee you the problems that
you're going to have in the coming
months is going to be turning down jobs.
And then you all are going to be coming
to me with template. Well, I have to oh,
I have to turn down this job. How am I
going to do that?
So everybody take a step back, give
yourself a little grace because you guys
are doing amazing. All right,
consistency.
Take baby steps.
Maybe you send out a bunch of of
LinkedIn connections.
Maybe you send out 10 a week. Maybe
five.
You're going to curate a meaningful
intro. And it doesn't I'm not saying
paragraphs. No, we're talking lean and
mean. And we'll we'll start looking at
what that looks like.
Another principle of nurturing a
relationship. Curiosity.
Asking thoughtful questions shows
general interest. An example. You
mentioned last time that you're leading
a new project. How's it going?
key
you and and you know what I would like
everyone on this call to think about and
maybe even copy a little bit of what
he's doing because that's smart. Hey,
can we meet up for a coffee chat? Do you
have 15 minutes for me to just kind of
run a few questions by you? That's good.
I I like that key. I like that. But and
that, you know, again, especially
people and I kind of think that
personally, especially developers
and also I found folks that are within
creative like designers and within
advertising, they love to talk about
themselves. They love it. Love, love,
love. And that's how you learn about
openings, learn about positions. Hi Kai.
Um, so
curiosity
we that is definitely a principle of
relationship nurturing.
One of my favorites.
A sorry Key or Kai. I'm sorry that
you're sick. Definitely hang back and
listen.
Gratitude.
Yes. Channeling Nando.
A simple thank you goes far.
Thanks again for sharing that article.
It's been useful. Thanks again for
sharing some of the um answers to my
questions. I realize that you weren't
able to spend some time with me in a
coffee chat, but this was so meaningful
and impactful that you carved time out
of your day to answer these questions
for me. I so appreciate it like and now
there's the entrance there's the
building and nurturing the relationship
and you know the last thing about
relationship nurturing is is value
sharing
right share something useful without
expecting anything back now you know
what now key has an entrance the door is
open now she can
email some of these contacts and say,
"Check out this project that I've been
working on that that we just produced at
Joy of Coding. This is what we do over
here." And then you know what? It's not
just plugging her and what she's doing,
but now it's hey, what's this joy of
coding?
Because ultimately what I want to do is
build these relationships with these
companies that all of you are applying
to. That's why I'm looking at your job
process sheet. It's not just to see who
you're reaching out to to see, oh, are
they doing this right or do are they
doing that right? No. No. You're helping
me help you because now I'm seeing where
you're applying. So, I'm reaching out to
these talent acquisition teams saying,
"Hey,
I'm working with some really incredible
students. You've actually connected with
one.
This is how it's done." So, let's
continue. Any questions or comments from
anyone into before I move on?
>> I have a question.
>> Sorry, I'm just
>> Yes.
>> Um, that that sheet you talked about,
where do I find that?
>> I will send it to you.
>> Oh, perfect. Thank you so much.
>> You're welcome. Um, all right. So, let's
go through some examples of genuine
check-ins. Okay.
Hi, Sam. I remember you mentioned you
were moving into project management or
product management. I came across this
article about transitioning careers and
thought of you.
Okay, that's a good opener. Another
example. Hey Taylor, congrats on your
2year anniversary. How many times have
you seen someone or LinkedIn post 2-year
anniversary? And what can you possibly
say? Well, congrats on your 2year
anniversary at company X. How has your
role grown since you started?
It makes it about them but also gives
you what you want information. Like do
you really want to be at this company?
Look at what key some of the the uh
mining the information mining that she
was able to get and now she knows I
don't want to work there. Value. That's
value right there.
Hey Alex, you mentioned your team was
expanding. How's that going? It must be
exciting. Simple.
So, which one of these feels more
natural to all of you? Was there any one
that that stood out that resonated with
any of you?
No. All of them liked them. Like, yeah,
they're all good. Okay.
>> Yeah, I thought they were all good.
There's not one in particular that was
better than the other. They all sounded
natural.
>> Okay. Very good. Very good. So now we
are going to
I'd like to do a little role play
exercise. Okay. So here's the scenario.
You connected with someone on LinkedIn
eight months ago after meeting at an
event.
You had a nice exchange, but haven't
spoken since. Now, you'd like to
reconnect in a way that feels natural
and genuine, not like you're suddenly
asking for something. Okay? So, I'd like
you to think about how would you break
the silence.
So, again, here's the scenario.
You connected with someone on LinkedIn
eight months ago after meeting at an
event.
You had a nice exchange but haven't
spoken since.
You'd like to connect in a way that
feels natural and genuine, not like
you're suddenly asking for something.
Draft
one to two a one to two sentence opener
that feels genuine.
I want you to think of a couple of
things.
What context do you share?
Can you show curiosity about their life
or their work? Can you share a small
update from your side?
So, take a few moments
to
draft
a one to two sentence opener that feels
genuine.
All
right. Now, when you all are ready
and if you would like to share, I think
we should go down the line. But if you
don't want to share, I understand.
But I really when you are ready to share
when you're finished, put your little
your little paw
little paw
Hey friends.
Oh, I see all of your gorgeous faces.
Everyone ready? If you are, show me some
thumbs.
Looks like hope looks like you're still
still cranking.
Okay, friends.
All right, Alyssa, why don't you kick it
off?
You're muted.
>> There we go. Got it. It's It's funny. A
little thingy tells tells me that I'm
muted, too. Blue button. Anyway, um
yeah. So, since I have no idea what this
meeting was about, I it's hard for me to
like imagine, but a lot of times I'll
see an article or something that reminds
me of someone. So, I'm going from from
that perspective of like, hey, I saw
this article reminded me of you or I
think you would be interested in it. And
then it's just kind of a segue into
like, "How have you been? Are you still
working for this company?"
>> Boom.
Yeah. Yeah. Seems genuine and authentic
to me. And especially she is reading an
article and she thought of someone. I
like it. John, I see I saw what you
said, what you had posted in the chat,
but why don't you talk us through it?
>> Yeah. Sorry. I did that before. I knew
we were going to be sharing verbally.
Okay. Um,
>> oh, good.
>> But,
>> but I'll follow it up with something new
that I was going to say anyway, but my
thing is just, hey, so and so, have you
been able to use
>> any of what we learned at that talk in
real life? I thought it was helpful with
such and such. Um, it's very generic
because we don't really know what
anything was. But if I had talked to the
person and I just found out some small
more personal thing like even like uh
like what city they were from and maybe
if they were into any sports like sports
I I I honestly myself don't watch that
much sports myself. I have siblings that
are crazy about it. But what it is good
for I think is to make little
connections like that. So, for example,
in my last uh interview, uh even though
it was very, you know, um professional
throughout, at the end of it,
>> I was able to get in a little cuz they
were from Chicago, so I and I'm from St.
Louis, so the Cardinal Cub rivalry,
right?
>> And boy, did I get this guy, boy, did I
get this guy going and finally smiling
and laughing. And uh nice that was that
was one of them that uh you know you
said I should reach out on LinkedIn even
after the interview and that guy did
eventually accept the thing and I'm sure
part of it was because of that small
little exchange right he's like oh I
like that guy right
>> um so if I had found at this uh
hypothetical talk that we were at with
somebody else if I had found out a
little something about them I would
probably throw that in there if I knew
they were kind of interested in
something like that little sports or
something. Yeah. Yeah, I like it. I like
it. Thank you. Thank you. Excellent.
Key, what you got for us?
>> Yeah, mine I mean mine's pretty generic,
too, just cuz, you know, I I like making
templates cuz, you know, I like Alyssa
struggle with like social interaction
sometimes. So, like having a template
that makes it plugandplay makes it so
much less like effort because like the
the emotional drain of having to like
deal with a person sometimes can be a
lot. Um,
>> so for me it's more of like, you know,
hey, um, whatever their name is, you
know, was like, especially if I've like
already connected with them was like,
hey, I was thinking about you. Saw this,
you know, post on LinkedIn that reminded
me of our, you know, previous like
interaction, thought like about you. So,
like, and then just kind of like ask
like how they're doing because um one of
the It's funny because I'm actually
needing to do that today with somebody
who I previously had a coffee chat uh
like two months ago with and they just
started a new job. So, now I'm like,
"Okay, you're six months in. How's the
new job?" Like, I need to go do that
with them today. So, that's like
legitimately of like, "Hey, I've been
thinking about you. Like, how's the new
job going?" You know, what have you
been, you know, learning on the job?
Still loving it. So,
Yep. Yep. What's changed? What's new? Is
there anything
exciting that you're working on that um
is going to be released that maybe you
can't talk about, but you can give me a
little a little taste. Like that's
that's that's where you go. And that's
great. And that's why the coffee chat
approach I'm really really liking. And
I'm thinking that we should all maybe
start adopting. I think I'm going to I'm
gonna
>> copy chat.
>> Some people I haven't been able to get a
coffee chat, but I have like three or
four like questions that I have like as
a template on reserve whether they're
like a recruiter versus like a software
developer. So, like I didn't get a
coffee chat with a different person, but
I gave them basically the three like
same questions that I've do you like
used during my coffee chat and they were
able to give like really like paragraph
responses back to me and I was like, "Oh
my boy." Like I was expecting like
three-word answers. So, um like you
>> people like talking about their jobs.
people like when when people are
employed and when they're employed
somewhere that they're really vibing,
they'll talk about it. Thank you very
much. Key Hope, what you got for us?
Yeah, I wrote down
I wrote down um hi Chelsea, we met at
the AI and the large machine learning
symposium in June. How are you doing?
Did you get a chance to work on the
Miami project?
That's what I wrote.
>> Boom. Simple.
Yeah. Reminding them, you know, hey,
this is where we met. great chat
bringing up and reminding them what they
talked about.
Um, so it's it's really it's a nice way
to remind people that you met and just
to stay on their radar.
So that's fantastic
and it's short and sweet. I love it. And
I I mean Kai It looks like he's using
the the coffee meeting as well. I love
that. Love that. I think we all should.
Really
excellent. We're That's going to be a
new a new piece courtesy of key. Nice
one. So, I I'd like to also provide a
couple of couple more sample openers. Um
one that is more contextbased.
Hi Jordan, I just saw an article about
UX design trends and it reminded me of
the great conversation we had about
design challenges last year.
How have things been on your end?
Right. Courtesy driven. Hi Sam, I
remember you mentioned you were starting
a new role around the time we last
spoke. How has that transition been for
you? Very similar to Keyy's situation,
right?
Gratitude and check-in. Hi, Taylor.
Thanks again for the advice you gave me
about project management tools last
year. I ended up using Trello and it's
been a great game changer. How's
everything been with you?
A life update. Anchor,
hi Chris. It's been a little while since
we connected. I recently started
freelancing at check at techjoy academy
and it made me think of your journey.
How have things been with your projects?
It may even be, like I said, if you
connected with someone when you were an
intern,
maybe now you graduated to that key
junior developer spot at Joocc
and maybe there's someone that you'd
like to say. Maybe there's a a software
developer like say in key situation that
she's reached out to over the past
couple of months and had some back and
forth exchanges on LinkedIn. you can let
them know, hey, guess what? I wanted to
share because I thought you might be
interested to hear that I am now
officially a junior developer at Joocc.
I'm working on some real projects. If
you don't mind, I'd love to share some
of the projects that I've been working
on once they've been produced.
Of course, going to Alyssa first, going
to Dr. Emily first asking permission to
see if it is a project that you can
share. You always do that.
they can they can share the uh like if
it's the if the project is on production
like support local for example they can
share the support local uh URL but they
can't share is the uh the code they
can't share the actual code base but
like anything on the front end
absolutely please talk about it
>> thank you understood what I want to do
is make sure folks are in the habit
of asking for approval
before they share client work. That is
very important. So just you know getting
used to that cadence. Yes, John.
>> Yeah, I actually had a question about
that. Um so at my last uh interview they
wanted to see both of those. I mean
support local which is already on
production but ensemble is not it's not
out there yet. It's going to be soon. I
mean, we can share it, but it's like
it's it's technically not like the
client hasn't really released it or
whatever. So, I was wasn't sure about
that.
>> What did they ask for? Did they ask to
see the code specifically or do they
just want to see
>> No, no, they wanted to see completed
project.
>> Yeah. In the app, they wanted to see
what I had worked on. But I have a
second follow-up question to that. Um,
so on my resume I for one of my own
projects I have the link to my own
project but then I was considering I was
like are you allowed to put the link to
you know either of the support local or
I probably wouldn't obviously do it for
consombo yet since it's not actually you
know really published yet per se but um
but like for support local and I'm I
guess I'm asking Alyssa she may know
Yeah, says you can. Ke put in and and uh
Alyssa confirmed that anything that
you've produced or launched during
challenge week can be shared.
>> Oh, that also. Yeah.
>> Yeah. Yeah. The challenge week stuff is
good. Um for Consemble, like I'm
actually on their website right now and
yeah, there's nothing on there. I would
double check with the uh the the
specifically the team lead on that
project because it also is a project by
project basis where like inclusive IQ
um we're trying to get people to sign up
but we don't really have anything to
show and I don't know if Roy wants us to
show it off yet you know so I would have
to ask it's more I think it's more about
the client
>> right
>> it is about us as leaders like even Dr.
Emily, it's really it's really like does
is the client ready to share it?
>> Yes. Yes. And that's why asking going to
Alyssa and Dr. Emily I feel is going to
be critical because you know uh with
Alyssa she's very close to the work and
she's very close to the students as a
coordinator and a mentor and PM. So that
is the chain of command that you would
go through if you were at any kind of
company, startup, organization,
whatever. You'd go to your PM, uh your
product manager. You would ask them then
they will likely talk to account
services, client services and then the
client services person will know hey um
uh okay so key from what she knows about
the uh consemble pro uh client currently
is not sharing the p the work yet and
it's likely because it hasn't been
produced right
>> yeah it hasn't been launched that was
the word I was looking for launched
>> launched
launched.
>> Exactly.
So, we've heard some uh sample responses
or sample approaches, right? So, let's
talk about weak transactional
openers that we don't really want to
use. Hi, I'm job hunting and wondered if
you'd know of any openings.
No.
Hey, we haven't talked in a while. Can
you refer me to your company?
No. Hey, do you have 15 minutes for a
call this week?
No.
And uh Kai just actually uh gave a a
great idea making a shared dock with
some of the reopening statements do and
don'ts.
Yeah, I'm digging that.
I like that. Everybody likes it. It's
good idea. So, the two K's Key and Kai
seems they're masters of the LinkedIn
approach. I love it. So,
to and I I hope if you have to drop at
12, I totally understand, but I'm going
to go until 12:15.
But we've got some, you know, I have
some sample responses,
uh, that I would like to just run
through if you don't mind. Um, so we've
got scenario one.
After a long silence, you would like to
approach
uh someone in your network. Hey Jordan,
it's been a while since we connected
after that UX event. I was just thinking
about our conversation and wanted to
check in. How have things been going? I
think I had run that one. I'm repeating
it. So, but that was after a long
silence.
Scenario two, after someone changed
jobs. I think kind of loosely threw this
out there already. Hey Sam, I saw you
started at Joy of Coding.
Congratulations.
I'd love to hear what your first few
months have been like. Make it about
them.
In making it about them, you're making
it about you without saying it's about
you.
Okay. Scenario three.
After uh they posted something
interesting.
Hi, Taylor. I really enjoy that post on
on I AI trends. I've been noticing some
of those shifts myself. That's been the
most surprising. What's been the most
surprising change you change you've seen
so far?
Okay.
Scenario four. After they had a work
anniversary, right? Hey, hey, Chris.
Congrats on your 2-year anniversary at
Joy of Coding. How has your own grow
your role grown since you started there?
After maybe after uh your connection
spoke on a panel or a podcast that you
heard and listened to. Hi Alex, I saw
you were on the panel about design
careers. Congratulations.
What was the best question you were
asked?
Maybe after they made a career change.
Hey John, I recently started freelancing
with TechJoy Academy and it reminded me
of our conversation about mentoring. How
have things been on your end?
Very difficult. after
a shared experience.
Hey Sam, I remembered we both joined
that virtual workshop on product
management last year. I'd love to hear
what stuck with you from it. Did you end
up using any of those strategies?
Like I'm assuming that there have been
people other students that you know who
have graduated from TechJoy Academy and
landed six-f figureure jobs. Yeah. You
know those people. Nod your head if you
have. Yeah.
Have you remained connected with those
people? When was the last time you sent
them a note asking them how they're
doing?
couple.
>> That's your end.
>> Yeah, that's your in to that company.
Just saying. Just a thought.
After they achieved something, that's uh
my scenario eight. Hey Jordan, congrats
on your promotion. What's been the most
exciting part of stepping into this new
role?
Maybe you want to circle back to them
after they've helped you before. Hey
Chris, thanks again for recommending
Trello a while back. It's really made
managing my projects so much easier.
How's everything going with your work
lately?
What maybe they've had a life change or
a a life update. Hey Taylor, I saw you
moved to Denver. Congrats on the big
change. How are you liking the new city
so far?
Right.
So,
notice how these messages are short,
specific, and warm
instead of transactional.
You're making it about them.
So, with some of these messages, how
would you feel if you received this
message?
What's the one way to make it feel even
warmer?
How would you tweak some of those
responses? Think about it, guys. Because
you know what?
It's going to be you.
You are going to have
Techjoy students,
other students in university,
other people reaching out to you very
soon,
right? So, the roles will will shift.
You know, which examples felt warm and
authentic? Were there any that felt more
transactional that you would shift? what
small details made the genuine ones
worth
and think about it that way.
So
the strongest relationships
aren't about what you can get today, but
about what you give and nurture over
time.
Okay. So, as we wrap up, what I'd like
to do is I'd like
uh to give you all a challenge, and it's
challenging yourself.
I'd like you to send two genuine
check-ins this week and track how people
respond.
[Music]
Yes, John.
>> So, one of them that I've been toying
with that I'm not quite sure if I
should. So, there a guy I went to high
school with is in the industry and he's
already he's been doing it since um
since college and he's already like at a
consulting level. He's he's a consultant
for it for it.
>> And uh but I haven't tal I haven't
talked to him since high school. And
it's not that we were like necessarily
friends, but we were like in all the
same classes and like you know we knew
each other. We participated in things
together, but we weren't necessarily
friends. Uh I didn't know if you had a a
good way of sending a friend request
there or a connection request with uh
like what you would say.
I mean, you already had a rapport with
this person. You knew them in high
school. So, seems like it would already
be somewhat relaxed and familiar, let's
say.
>> Yeah.
>> And and assuming the last time you were
in touch with him was years and years
ago when you were in high school. I
mean, simple.
Hey, whatever his name is. It's so nice
to see you. I stumbled on your profile.
uh on LinkedIn. It's been so long. Um
I'm actually also
involved in uh this practice, you know,
talk to, you know, I'd love to to
connect. Do you, you know, maybe have
some time to connect for a coffee chat?
Is he local? Could you possibly meet up
for coffee in person? Like that's even a
sweeter opportunity.
Yeah.
>> Yeah. I'd love to connect and catch up.
Exactly, Alyssa. I'd love to hear about
the exciting things that you've been
doing and, you know, just life and just,
you know, connect and Exactly. Connect
and catch up. This is really the
sweetest thing because you already have
an established relationship, but it's
been a while and now you can connect in
person. That's even even nicer.
Okay, thank you.
>> Yeah.
Now in this evening if you are all able
to attend
um it's we are going to continue
drilling into showing up authentically
um on LinkedIn but we are going to be
focusing more about um
best practices in uh commenting and the
rule the three rules of a genuine
network message. Make it specific. Um
adding the curiosity. So yeah, we'll be
kind of reiterating a little bit of what
we've discussed, but we'll be drilling
down even more. So I would love to uh
see all of you uh this evening, but
understand if you're not able to make
it, but this has been a great great
session. Um, does anyone have any
questions or concerns uh before I give
you
time to go eat some lunch
or send some networking messages?
Anyone?
Are we good? I don't see anybody else's
hands. Yeah.
All good. How was this session? Was this
valuable for all of you? Yeah.
Excellent. Good. Good.
>> And again, I cannot state this enough. I
am here. I work for all of you
and Dr. Emily, of course, but I work in
partnership with Dr. Emily and
everything that she is teaching you.
This curriculum is rich and amazing
and it you know it
what I am am doing is backing her and I
am supporting you all about you guys.
So, if there's something that doesn't
feel right with what I'm I'm teaching,
if you have questions, concerns,
whatever it is,
hit me up on Discord. I'm here.
All right.
All good.
So, hopefully I will see you guys later,
but again, feel free to reach out if you
need anything between now and then.
Okay friends, enjoy your afternoon.
