https://youtu.be/h_3tUhdck8o

Oh my gosh.
I am sorry ladies. I do not know what
happened.
Okay, let me get back to where I was.
Okay, and back to where I was. I am so
sorry.
Okay.
All right. So, here we are. Software
engineer in quotes.
There's the space.
A N.
All right. And then Amazon.
And then we go down to
CL results.
Now
it goes along with all of these filters
here. So starts with jobs.
You can see all the jobs for software
developers.
Okay, let's go back.
What we're looking for, we're looking
for people, right?
But this is fun. Look at this
talent at Amazon who's actively hiring.
They're posting jobs. Another recruiter
software support engineer for Amazon.
Software engineers resume tips. Hello.
Great post. And now
here are some people.
There it is.
Software engineers. And then you can
click here and see all of the software
engineers
at Amazon.
Do you have your location
set to New York for this search or is it
just selfidentifying that?
>> Uh, might be I don't know.
Let me look on locations. I think it's
just self-identifying because it's
looking for software engineers.
I don't think it's looking specific for
a specific location because remember
what we did is we put in software
engineer and Amazon.
>> We didn't specify.
>> I I was just noticing that all the
software engineers that are popping up
are all
>> Well, this one is Seattle.
>> That's true.
Um, it's a huge hub
for Amazon in general,
but
you know, you could certainly go through
all of these pages and continue to see
where folks are located. We've got San
Francisco,
a lot of folks in the city,
but there are other people, other areas
was really my search is really just
about
software engineers,
Jersey City,
Somerville.
So yeah, keep going.
Does that answer your question, Mindy?
>> Yes, completely.
>> Okay, so let's do more. So another
operator word
or.
So
example, you're looking for full stack
developer
or front-end developer. It'll show both
types of developers.
Let me go home. Start a new search
and we do quotes
space or
front end.
Maybe you're open to both of these
roles. Maybe you're looking for jobs
or people.
Now, let's start it this way.
Okay.
Straight away, they gave you jobs
and you can even save these job
if you would like.
You could see all the jobs. Keep
scrolling.
Look like they pulled a full stack
developer position. Full stack Java
developer
all posts that maybe people
posted out the jobs that were open.
And then you've got your people, your
first, second, and third connection. And
then you can even click this tab, who's
actively hiring.
And then you've got people here,
more jobs.
Now, let's take this even further.
Let's add
an operator. Maybe you want to find full
stock developers or front-end developers
at Amazon
and
Amazon. Let's see what we come up with.
Some jobs
posts
And then people
all people in those positions and then
more jobs,
right?
Go home again.
Let's
Here's a good one.
using not
which you want to exclude a term
maybe recruiter
not HR
you want to see recruiters but not HR
recruiters
okay let's do this
recruiter
Not
HR.
Let's actually do this.
Tech recruiter, not agent.
This is
general just looking for tech
recruiters.
You can see in you you know identify
some tech recruiters if you want to do
this kind of search. Maybe you're
looking for a tech recruiter not HR
at Amazon and
Amazon
Now, these are interesting. I wonder I
put Amazon, but it's pulling up Chrome
or Google. Strange.
All right,
here we go.
can look at some of these recruiters and
then see if
you might want to reach out to some of
these folks.
And then maybe for someone like me
who's looking for a full-time recruiter
role, this would be good for me to take
a look at.
Now, when I started doing boolean
searches, I didn't really understand
where the quotation marks came in. It's
meaning you really want an exact phrase
match. So, let's say machine learning
engineer.
That will give you the exact job title,
not just the words separately. Okay. So,
let's see
machine
learn.
Come here.
Here we are.
Some of those jobs you can look at.
posts
positions.
Some more positions
for some people.
See many people here.
It's interesting.
and parenthesis.
So that's when you're grouping terms for
complex projects.
Stop sh.
>> Yes. Hi.
Um,
one thing that I've always found
confusing was full stack like all the
different terms are almost written
different ways. You know, some people
make it one word, some people make it
hyphenated, different capitalizations,
space separated.
Is there a a place to sort of get like a
I don't know a collection of these terms
so that they're searched all search or
do you have to go through it
individually?
Um
>> that's a good question. I don't have the
answer to that.
>> Okay.
>> Can't you do like
couldn't you use the like terminology
with the search characteristics?
I'm not familiar with like
>> um so
in
the SQL in the database searches
we'll use um searching when we search
for a string we'll use like
and quotes.
It might work. It's worth a shot.
>> Never used like in my Google searches
but sure. I mean
try,
you know, play with all of this.
No,
we'll be going through this again um in
uh session B this evening and doing a
little bit more you know interacting
um
you know interacting with each other in
searches interacting with LinkedIn but I
you know I really just want to reinforce
that LinkedIn is not
you
a passive tool that you just kind of
throw your profile up. It's an active
search and networking tool.
You can really utilize this and and
really get somewhere.
Any uh any questions?
I had one thought when you showed um you
pointed out some company that had 10,000
employees.
Is there an approach to
interacting with a job post that's for a
company that's of that scale? Obviously,
searching through the employees would
take forever
and there are ways to filter it down, it
sounds like, but um Should we be like
targeting specific departments or areas?
Is that even something that we can
>> Yeah.
>> identify?
>> Absolutely.
>> Yeah. Just like I've been saying in in
these Q&A sessions, it's the hiring
leads if that's posted, the recruiters
that's posted, and if you're
um not applying to a specific role where
they might have the identity of the
poster, it's about going straight to the
source. Who is sourcing for these roles?
Recruiters. That's the first line of
fire.
Then you start sussing out who might be
a hiring lead or folks that you feel
would be worth connecting with at a
target company.
>> Okay. Thank you.
>> You're welcome. Um so let me get going
because I believe there's another
meeting at 1:00. Um but any further
questions, please join me this evening
at 6 PM.
Thank you very much.
