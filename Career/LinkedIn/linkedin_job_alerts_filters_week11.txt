https://youtu.be/M-iT2pBF5Ec

Good morning. How are you?
>> Good morning. How is everyone today?
>> Absolutely lovely.
>> Oh, good. I'm glad to hear it.
>> Now, where are you located at?
At the moment I am in upstate New York.
>> Oh, okay. Okay. So, it's like noon by
you. Okay.
>> Yes.
>> Yes, it is.
>> Gotcha.
>> Well, I sent you the say is here, but
since we don't have anybody here yet,
you saw my LinkedIn and you were saying
it looks pretty good. So, um,
>> we'll have our meeting.
>> There are a couple things that we'll
talk about. Yeah. I mean, there's a
couple things that I would shift and
change,
>> but,
>> you know, we can we can talk about that.
>> Yeah.
>> Let's hope. Yeah. Usually take a couple
of minutes to allow people in to get
some time.
>> It It does help. I wonder if say are you
also applying there's hope I okay hello
hope are you also applying for jobs say
>> hi
>> no I'm not
>> oh okay
>> I'm not I'm not applying right now
because I have some kind of stuff going
on but still I I have one question uh if
I have a gap like uh whenever I I try to
you know to to would
to apply and do everything. I feel like
my uh my profile have some kind of gap.
How I feel it?
How I can fill that gap?
>> Well, what were you doing during that
gap?
>> Um it's not really official. Uh I'm
working as it in my country, but here
I'm working as warehouse worker or
anything else.
But still I'm working as it from like 10
years ago you know
>> and I don't think I'm following you. I
need to take a look at your LinkedIn
profile say
>> okay
>> so
um you know message me on Discord and we
should schedule time to connect for a
one-on-one.
>> Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Um, and also
unless you're driving or if you're under
the weather and sick, I always request
that people have their video on.
So, if you're able to do that, that
would be that would be wonderful because
we do engage a lot in my sessions.
>> Okay. I'm I'm trying to do that, right?
>> Okay.
And I'm just um
>> I was going to tell you say that as I
was doing my applications through
LinkedIn,
>> it has a you match you're not a good
match. You're not a good fit for this or
um you may be able to fit. I don't know
if that's a premium thing or if it's
just something that that you didn't see,
but there's a way where it says um if
you're not a good match, add skills and
it allows you to add skills at various
times and to highlight them. May not be
on your resume, but it's on the they did
make it so that I could put it on the
LinkedIn. So, is that Chelsea? Is that a
um premium feature or is that on the
regular stuff where it will do the am I
a good fit?
>> Um I'm not 100% sure. It could be a
premium feature. And I believe that you
know if you are very uh if you are
involved in a serious job hunt that uh
investing
in premium is I think going to be
necessary.
>> I did I did invest.
>> Yeah. I actually did myself
and they have a year I believe it you
can do a year and just pay outright but
I believe you can do monthly as well.
>> Yeah.
>> And all up it's about $257
for the year.
So, but that's what I I do recommend
getting premium
um because it also helps make you more
visible to recruiters as well. So, hey
Leo, how's it going?
>> Doing good.
>> All right.
All right. So, we are at
12:05.
Let me get my
notes up here. Okay,
so today will definitely be an
interesting session.
Um this is week 11
and you know if you have not been
attending my sessions
uh since we started um you know already
uh or you you know that you can always
go back right you can always go back to
the um the video the recordings
um but I we should definitely go over
what we've been uh doing for o over the
past couple of weeks. Um we
have been focusing on
um all LinkedIn and why it matters. So
when I started in early July and when we
began doing these sessions,
um, week one is when we really covered
why LinkedIn matters and understanding
it as a formal job tool. Uh, week two we
did the profile basics, right? We talked
about photo, headline, banner, contact
info, all very important. Week three,
crafting a compelling summary, talking
about you, who you are, what you can
offer.
Critical, adding those key words that
you find in some of the job descriptions
that you've been applying to so that
those key words can be pulled in
searches that recruiters do on LinkedIn.
Again, I can't impress upon you all
enough. Recruiters live on LinkedIn. It
is our virtual database. Um,
week four we talked about highlighting
skills, projects and education. Again,
searchable visibility very important.
Week five, custom URL and settings. How
to customize your URL in the contact
section on the upper portion of your
LinkedIn profile. Also very important
making sure that your settings make you
more visible. And we'll be doing a
little bit more sort of on settings but
more in job preferences today.
This is when we really get down to the
nitty-gritty and allow you to control
what you see, what alerts you receive,
and how to authorize LinkedIn to do the
work for you.
Now, week six and seven were a little
bit of dual
sessions, right? Um, both were about
building your network,
but
week six, which was part one, was about
connecting and sending invites for
people that you want to connect with,
right? And now week seven was the part
two to that of building your network.
So, part two, we talked about keeping
relationships
warm uh with authenticity.
Week eight, we started crafting. We
started amping up and building that
network by sending messages and and
talking about how to do cold outreach
uh with your alumni, recruiters,
hiring managers.
Week nine, we talked about how to ask
and how to write rate recommendations.
This is not a one-way street here. It's
a two-way street. And this is how you
build continue building your network.
Because again, and I can't impress upon
you all enough.
You will not get a job by only sending
applications.
It's not going to happen.
The way that you get a job is through
networking. The way that you get a job
is through commenting on pe people's
posts, adding your own posts,
giving yourself value
along with that visibility.
It is a long game and it is a
two-pronged approach. Okay. And now week
10, which was last week,
we talked about engaging with LinkedIn
as a platform.
Session A, we talked about posting
content, commenting on posts, and using
hashtags.
And then
session B, we talked about the same. we
reviewed, but we also uh went a little
bit deeper into writing and posting
uh your first updates with some
guidance. Okay, so
we honestly don't have a ton of time
left in these LinkedIn series. Uh I
think in
three maybe four weeks we'll be wrapping
up with LinkedIn.
So each
review and each week we continue
building and building and building. So
this week, week 11,
uh we in session A are going to be
talking about how to set up job alerts
and use filters within LinkedIn. Session
B is going to um I will have all of you
practice using search tools and
identifying roles.
So
today
we're taking the guesswork out of job
hunting. Okay. So I will be showing you
how to set up LinkedIn so it works for
you.
Sending fresh
relevant roles straight to your inbox
the moment they go live. And that is
what I recommend because if all of you
have been looking at jobs on LinkedIn,
how raise of hands, how many of you have
noticed that
100 plus people have already applied to
roles that you are applying to.
Yeah. Yeah. I recommend applying to
roles that are My hand won't go down.
Uh, where do I react? Lower my hand.
Okay. Um,
now I lost my train of thought. Um,
basically I will be showing you how to
set up LinkedIn so it works for you. So
sending fresh, relevant roles straight
to your inbox the moment that they go
live. I recommend
alerting getting job alerts for roles
that have been posted within the past 24
hours because if that is the case,
if that is the case then
you will be the first to be seen and
we'll talk a little bit more about that.
So no more endless scrolling, no more
missing out because you were late to
apply.
Um so why why does this matter?
Recruiters see early applicants first
and and that is critical right and then
the earlier you apply the better your
shot.
So I
my grandmother is going to be 101
this year
and she is in uh she just went into a
nursing home and I visit her I sit with
her two or three times a week because
she is our precious precious precious
national treasure of our family. and she
always tells me when I talk to her about
how I'm trying to get a job and you know
and even in her 101 years of age she
says to me every day she sees me the
early bird gets the worm and she also
always likes to use the uh when life
gives you lemon you make lemonade I like
that one too but I've been leaning on
those do things a lot. Um, so shout out
to Rosemary.
Um, so we are going to
go step by step together. Okay, all of
you right now pull up your LinkedIn
profile to your screen
and I am going to do the same.
Now, mine gets a little bit wonky
because I have all of this set up.
So,
I may ask one of you to share your
screen
as well at some point. So,
oops. Why didn't that work? Where did
you go? Oh, there you are. There we go.
Perfect.
Now
actually let me share my screen.
What's happening here?
Here we go. Okay.
All right.
And
there we go. Can everyone see
my screen?
Oops.
Oh, no.
Yep. Everyone can see my screen. Okay.
Beautiful. Beautiful. So on we're going
to do this together and everyone has
their LinkedIn profile up as well. Yeah.
Great.
So,
so what we're going to do is we're going
to go to this little briefcase up here
that says jobs.
Let's go to that screen.
All right,
everybody there?
Yeah. Okay.
All right.
Now,
what I like to do
is up here in this describe the job you
want.
Write the job that craft the job that
you want. Write in the title. I'm going
to do the same. I'm going to put
I'm going to put
for myself. I do have career coach. I'll
do that again.
Okay. Now, everyone in in your
slot,
write type in the role that you want.
Just the role, not where, none of that
because we'll get to that. Yeah. Is
everyone there?
Yes. How you doing, Leo?
I want to make sure we are all on the
same page.
Okay, now
you've got your jobs here on the left
hand side and then of course it has more
of a description.
Okay, so look how is this going to help
me, right? Okay. Director of career
services and strategic national employer
outreach. Okay.
But look at all this.
Oh, this is a good one. This was posted
20 hours ago, but some of these other
roles were posted four weeks ago. That's
no no good. No good. So, let's go up to
date posted and click that arrow.
Past a month, past week, past 24 hours.
I don't think you could do two. Yeah,
you could only do one. Now,
show results.
Here we go.
Beautiful.
20 hours,
18 hours,
21 hours, 17 hours, 16 hours. Yeah. Oh,
look at this. A tutor 48 minutes ago. So
now I'm not really a t tutor and I don't
know,
you know, I'd have to read the job
description, but still,
you know, you've got this. Now, let's
let's look a little bit here. Let me
let me move this up
and down a little bit. Look at this.
This job search alert is on. If this job
search under this title
is something you want as an alert,
click this. You want it on
because what happens is LinkedIn will
email you these alerts and let you know
what jobs have just been posted within
the past 24 hours. And if you're
available,
you can apply. And then hope Leo,
you have been pretty consistent in
session A for LinkedIn.
After you apply
to the job, one of you tell me what the
next step is.
So, you've looked at LinkedIn or you
received your alert
>> and you apply then
>> Well, well, I would first I would apply
directly to the company and not through
LinkedIn.
>> Yep.
>> Right.
>> Yeah. I if it says to do the easy apply
there,
>> I wouldn't I wouldn't easy apply.
I would go straight to if it's got, you
know, uh if it has information
about applying.
Yeah. Here, visit us at arut.com for
more information. That's where I would
apply. I at least I would look to see if
the application is there.
I would always apply to the job directly
on the the website. So yes, good call.
Continue. Hope.
>> Um I think
maybe cuz on a lot of these um on mine
it says you're missing your profile is
missing required qualifications.
And then I guess I could click on that
and see.
>> But say you you applied.
>> Oh, okay.
>> Say you already say you applied. You
were like, you know what? I'll be the
judge
>> if I can do this job. So, I'm going to
apply. I'm going to live life on the
edge
>> and I'm gonna apply to this job. So, you
apply to this job and then you're going
to do a little snooping.
Okay. Well, I definitely want to follow
the company if I'm applying to it. So,
yeah, let me
>> let me follow this company. Let's see
what other Oh, maybe I didn't want to do
that. Okay, here we go. So, after you
apply,
you're going to go over to the company
and now h let's see if we can identify
some
talent acquisition or recruiters that
may be recruiting for this position. 11
to 50 employees. Okay. Oh, right at the
top. Look at that.
Executive recruiter and advisor.
Okay.
Let's see. Ah,
Ranjani Raman,
lead talent acquisition specialist.
All right, let's do another quick scan.
Ah, this is the head of talent
acquisition. Okay, who else do we have
here?
Uh, this guy's the founder.
Okay, what's next? Let's see what else
we've got here.
Okay.
Workshop facilitator, learning coach,
program manager, not so much a
recruiter.
A lot of coaches. Coaches here.
>> All right. So, based on the first couple
of pages. Yes.
Wouldn't you also want to check out who
your who your connections are? Your
first, second, and third connections
might be to see if you know anybody over
there. Just
>> Sure.
>> Sure. But that's not a different
>> Yeah. No, I would be focusing on who's
recruiting for the position first.
Um, and I think that we found that
straight away on the first page.
I would
probably
connect with Ranjani Raman.
And when I connect with her, it says add
a note, which I highly recommend you do.
And in that note, you will let her know.
Scan back.
I don't want to lose this page.
Come on.
Okay. H We lost it. Let's
There we go. head of coaching.
You can let them know, hey,
so nice to meet you
along with this invite.
I wanted to
thank you for your time and
consideration. I recently applied to the
head of coaching position
on your website.
Leave a couple bullets of what you can
offer.
add your resume
and then
maybe search through a little bit deeper
folks that
you find interesting
from that company. And yes, Mindy, you
can look and see what connections you
already have there. And then maybe
that's how you base your next
connection.
Any
questions
so far?
Okay. Now, sometimes
what you can do is target companies
within this
capability.
It doesn't show a ton of results, but
really it seems like these are the folks
that are really hiring. Let me see what
this does.
Nothing. It already showed results. But
again, too, look at this. This here is
where you can adjust
location.
Okay.
So,
save more than one search.
This is what I would do. So, maybe full
stack developer remote plus QA engineer
NYC
or wherever you're located.
Follow company pages so you hear about
jobs before they go public. Happens all
the time.
Okay. So, we're going to practice this
together. So everyone set up right now
one alert
and then when you're finished just raise
put on your virtual hand and then we
will share the role and filters.
We'll give you all five minutes.
Um Chelsea
uh on mine LinkedIn it says hope uh
don't forget to verify before reaching
out. Uh verified members attract 60%
more profile viewers on average. So
verify now I guess because I
I mean, you can it it's a process.
So, I don't know if it's something you
can do in real time right now.
>> Oh, okay. I I did try it one time and it
went ask a lot of stuff.
>> Yeah. QR code and has you do all this
other stuff. So, yeah, you can totally
um uh you can uh but I would just
recommend to do it at another time.
Yeah.
Okay.
Are we
have we completed or do you guys need a
little bit more time?
Well, all I've done is actually is
identified the job and followed the
company
and found some person in the company
who's a talent acquisition person, but I
didn't message them or anything.
>> Okay. So, what we were doing as this
practice, just so you know, you set up
one active alert.
>> Oh. Oh, yeah. Then you share the role
and and then you you know you go through
the the role title and put on the
filters and then we all discuss what
you've done.
>> Okay.
>> So we're not sending anything yet. We're
just setting up our filter really and
and
>> putting setting one alert.
>> Okay. Who would like to share their
screen and show what they've done?
If no one volunteers, I'm going
>> Oh, I can do it. I I don't have a
problem.
>> Okay. Because eventually everyone is
going to be sharing and showing. So, who
wants to do it first?
>> We're gonna see you tomorrow anyway. So,
there you go.
Okay. Share. Hold on.
Um, you can see my LinkedIn
and
>> Okay, I
>> All right, ma'am. Yes. So, let's go over
to jobs.
>> Yep.
>> And see what jobs you did. Yep, you did
that. Yep. So, go to the drop down on on
the left underneath the in. Yep.
>> And now
we're going to look at all jobs. Yeah.
>> Yeah.
>> Or you put in Okay, I get it. You put in
All right.
But I had
>> There we go.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. But I did have um the within the
24 hours I did some filtering on it. So,
>> okay. So,
uh I think we need to go back. Go back.
>> Okay. There we go.
>> There we go.
>> And so, you did the past 24 hours.
Great.
in San Diego. Great.
>> And let's scroll through some of the
jobs to see what you've got here.
>> So, the first So, I did look through a
few of them. I'm sorry. I'm going to
move the toolbar here because I hate
when the toolbars.
Okay. So, this AIML design quality
engineer, that's a little out of where I
feel comfortable. It's not,
>> but it says I'd be a top candidate, and
I'm like, I don't know. I mean, that
just doesn't sound right.
Um,
>> well, did you look through the job
description?
>> Yeah, I did.
>> Okay.
>> All right. If you don't feel that it's
right for you, then you just keep it
moving.
>> There were 100 over a hundred applicants
already as well.
>> Yeah. So, this one it but I said in the
past 24 hours. So, what
Oh, 17 hours ago. 18 applied. Okay. This
one's closer.
>> Okay.
This one's better.
the North for Grumman. They usually want
a security clearance which just drives
me crazy.
Um,
yeah, they want a security clearance and
that ain't going to I I don't have one
of those. Not that I wouldn't qualify,
but just that you have to have an
employer that asks you about it. Um.
>> Mhm.
>> And this is not I'm certain that the
abena
um yeah, it's not really in because this
one is
doing um more on the inspection type
side is what I'm getting. Yeah. Cuz I
don't do the inspection side. I do the
software testing which is why I put
software.
>> That's fine.
>> Yeah.
>> Um so you just keep it moving then keep
scrolling through and you know basically
it was let's see what you've done. So
you pulled this up. If there are other
roles that you feel you want to search
for this is how you do it.
>> Yep. And actually they're not terrible.
It's not a terrible match, but it said,
you know, basically it said, well, what
do you think about these matches?
And
I'm not I'm not liking the matches that
it gave me.
So, there was one where it said,
"How did we do?" And I said, "Not so
good on this one." I mean, there were
only two that looked like they were
promising.
So, I'm going to go ahead and save that
one until later because that one looks
good.
And
>> okay,
>> that one looks good.
Um,
>> okay. I mean, you're not going to get I
mean, it might not be spoton every time,
>> but this will at least allow you to
review what has been posted within the
past 24 hours.
>> Right. Well, here's what I'm going to do
now.
Automation engineer.
>> Okay.
>> I'm going to put in there
test automation engineer.
Hit enter.
>> Okay.
>> And see what I get. 14 results.
Um,
this is looking a little closer,
but I didn't do that one yet. So, I'm
going to save that one.
>> Yeah.
>> And this is what you do. And it allows
you to move move swiftly. And now
>> when you're applying,
you're not using the same resume that
you use for every single role.
>> Correct.
>> You're you're tailoring your resume.
>> Yeah.
>> And now I know Mindy, you and I are
going to talk about this a little bit
more tomorrow, but for Hope and Leo,
>> I crafted their resume template.
And the réé template that I craft is an
ATS friendly functional style resume.
And you'll see what I mean by that when
I craft it for you. Um,
>> okay.
>> And it is basically meant to be your
template. And you take that template,
>> you throw it in your AI tool, whatever
platform you choose to use. You ask it
to tailor. you attach it and you say,
"Tailor this resume" to the job
description below.
>> Okay?
So you're not reinventing the I mean you
are reinventing the wheel every time in
a way but you're just making small
updates
>> and then you have copies of that resume
that you sent in case
>> someone calls you and says hey
>> I want to connect with you and meet with
you right
>> you ready for what I do I I'm kind of
tricky about all of this I have my
resume folder
And for each one that I send in, I set I
I have I'm going to Sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm going to share one more time.
>> Um
I have the name of the resume, basically
the job
>> and the date that I created it
>> and what I'm looking for
>> to be doing on that. So, I thought it I
thought it's funny because I'm like,
yeah, I'm trying to get there where I've
got more of a system. It doesn't always
work that well, though, because
sometimes I find little mistakes and I
need to be better as a QA person. I
should be better at going through and
finding the mistakes before I send them
out. But, but it happens.
>> Well, you know what I use is Grammarly.
I use Grammarly to help and it is a free
platform. I mean, you can pay for stuff
too, but Grammarly does help spot
uh punctuation and grammar errors.
>> Okay.
>> Um, so, you know, it's it's what Dr.
Emily says all the time. You've got this
technology, utilize it. It's here to
help you. If you are resistant in
utilizing the technology,
then the tech then you know the the
technology is is going to overwhelm you.
You have to be one like it's like
getting into a car and refusing to use
the GPS when you're taking a trip and
you don't know where to go, right? I'm
I'm looking at it as we are c we are
computer professionals and if we haven't
accepted the fact that they are
um those tools are designed to help us
and we need we want people to use the
tools that we invent. We should you take
ad to the other ones that people invent.
So, I'm I'm right there with
>> um but I do
>> and another
>> I was going to say I still have my
issues with
>> chat GPT sometimes because I think about
what may be all over the internet
sometimes. I'm I'm trying to remind
myself that if I
>> I could delete the history and we could
make it somewhat go away, but some of it
depending on what you put out there. But
still, most of what I put out there is
pretty public stuff as far as what I've
done, that type of stuff. So,
>> well, you can always go into your
settings on chat GPT and click that you
do not want your data shared.
>> That's what I did.
>> There you go. There you go.
>> Yeah. Yeah. There are always those sort
of things that you can do. Um, Leo,
uh, what did talk to me a little bit
about the roles that you were searching
and and what you found.
>> Okay.
The roles that I've been looking for or
whatnot is basically remote only. That's
pretty much what I've been fishing for.
And as for how I was doing it is that I
have the notification thing notification
thing that you were talking about today.
Uh I had a setup in my previous boot
camp
>> uh for both full stack front end and
back end.
>> Beautiful. So you had a wide range.
>> Mhm.
>> Yeah. And now did you find a good amount
of roles when you clicked within 24
hours? Did you know about that feature?
>> Yeah. Yeah, it's I have it automatically
set up. So when I click the see more tab
on the email, it pulls it up on either p
uh either 24 hours or two days ago.
>> Nice. Okay. Very good. So you give
yourself a little bit of time. You're
casting a little bit of a wider net.
Okay. Very nice.
>> Since in recent times, remote work has
died down since 2020.
>> Yeah. Yeah. A little bit. Yeah. There
still are some of those roles, but a lot
of people are applying to those. But I
think it's great that you're giving
yourself, you know, like a wider, you
know, sort of range, and that's great.
It's, you know,
>> I what I tell all of you are
suggestions.
I think what I've been teaching all of
you for the past 11 weeks that I feel
like I stand on the soap box and scream
for as loud as I possibly can. It really
really is about the networking piece.
Just applying
is not going to do it in this job
market. Precoid and during like 2020 and
2021.
Yeah. There were a lot of mass hirings,
tons and tons of hires.
Um that's not going to work now.
>> Yeah.
>> It's not it can't be your only
your your only game plan. Like it's
really about networking. And I keep
saying it. It is it is the long game.
Right.
>> So, just really like
I know that so many of us, me included,
we want to find a home, a permanent
home. Don't worry if I get a permanent
