https://youtu.be/cs0KJ-dW70U

Hello.
Good evening, good afternoon
everyone.
I am just going to take a couple of
minutes to allow folks to
start streaming in.
While all of you are um waiting, if you
wouldn't mind copy and pasting
your LinkedIn profile into the chat.
Everything.
Hello friends.
Anyone who has just joined it, please
add your uh LinkedIn profile to the
chat.
>> You mean just the link or the whole
thing?
>> Just the the LinkedIn. Just the the link
to LinkedIn. Yeah.
It's a tongue twister. Say that 10 times
fast.
And if you can hop on video,
if you can do that, if you're in a
position to do that, that would be
awesome. Um, and then anyone who has
arrived late, please add the link to
your LinkedIn profile and chat, please.
Maybe we'll give one more minute.
How's everyone doing today?
Thumbs up.
How about the folks with their video not
turned on?
Okay. Thanks, Leo.
>> Um, I didn't know we have to turn it on,
so I am not video ready. So,
>> you don't need glam, Anna. It's okay.
But I understand. No need for glam. Look
at Look at John. John John's got his
lashes on.
Just kidding.
But you know what, Anna? That is just
fine. Your your energy and your presence
radiates from the photograph.
Thank you.
Okay.
Okay, everyone. So to this evening uh is
going to be pretty similar to my 12 noon
session. Um I've decided that I'm going
to vary things slightly but cover almost
the same thing because it's all
important and I don't want people to
miss certain sessions because I think
they're all very critical.
I have been uh also uh reviewing um Dr.
Emily's job hunt videos
and
I they are phenomenal. I don't know if
you have access to them when you reach
certain
modules or it's you know when you reach
intern or junior developer. Um I am to
report back to Dr. Emily on anything
that I might want to fix or shift or
change. Um, but I've got to tell you,
she's got I she's really
built such an impressive program. Um,
and she's really covered so much. Uh, so
I I'm really excited to be able to
partner with her uh on this. So, um,
okay, Glenn buyers,
uh, okay, so don't worry, we're going to
start rebuilding LinkedIn profiles and
evolving them, so this is not a problem.
Um, the goal for this evening is to
really drill down and understand the key
components of a professional profile and
and why they matter.
Um, and
you know, it's to allow you to leave
this session with an actionable list
of uh what you should change and really
just kind of start thinking about how to
refine your LinkedIn profile and and you
know, just to
just to review what we went over yes or
last week. Um to recap,
LinkedIn is a recruiter's first stop,
right? 95% of recruiters and hiring
managers use it daily to source talent.
So, even if you've applied to a position
through a job board, um they'll often
check your LinkedIn profile before
reaching out. If you are referred to
them from an internal hiring manager, an
external recruiter, perhaps uh a friend
who is just like, "Oh, this resume came
across my desk. Check this person out."
They'll look at your LinkedIn profile
first. It's just what we do. Um, and it
allows you to get a feel for people. It
serves as your public resume and
reputation all in one. Your photo and
headline
equals
your first impression, right? Their
first impression.
So what to today's today's session is
going to cover
is is you know why it matters for
recruiters and hiring managers to see um
what why your headline your banner and
your photo matter. It all seems very
small
but it's not right. So
does anyone have any questions so far?
Anything? Anyone
has if has anyone been thinking about
our sessions from last week and have any
questions or any topic they would like
to revisit before we push forward with
this uh breaking down of each segment.
Good.
Okay.
So,
we are going to first talk about the
profile photo.
Um, and the reason why I had you all uh
and if you joined late and if you
haven't yet, please add your the link to
your LinkedIn profile in the chat.
We are going to be taking a look at
those.
So the profile pick, okay?
Why uh a good photo matters? It's first
impression and profile visibility,
right? So what are the guidelines? What
are the dos and don'ts? a nice clear
head shot,
something professional, a clear
background showing you in a, you know,
professional attire.
Uh, casual
but neat. Doesn't have to be, you know,
a suit and tie. Although,
John, I mentioned this this week. You
look pretty spiff in your profile pick.
Very nice. I like the suit tie or
looking fresh to death. I like it. Um,
good lighting,
plain or blurred background,
and then a friendly, approachable
expression.
Sweet, clean, keep it simple.
Um, don't
use a selfie or a filter.
Include don't include others in your
photo.
I absolutely love animals of all types,
but we've got to keep our pets out of
headlines and profile photographs. I
And I'm all about the animals, but in
this case, we need to
we need to keep it just just you, just
the profile shot. Um, and then don't use
a a low resolution photo. Use something
that's nice and crisp. Now, there are
free tools that exist.
Canva cropping, using your phone,
portrait mode, and actually there are a
good amount of um photographers who you
can I find on YouTube that give you
little to tutorials about how to
sit, how to angle your body, how to work
with the lighting settings on your
iPhone. I have seen some beautiful
profile photographs of folks that um are
super professional and they did them
themselves
also. And Nando does not know that I'm
doing this. Nando's partner is a
photographer.
Perhaps he would be open to you are on
the East Coast uh doing a session of
professional photographs. Um he is an
amazing photographer, but there are
folks that specialize in that type of um
photography.
Also, oftentimes, if you are going to a
job fair or some sort of tech uh event,
South by Southwest, um any other tech
events, oftent times
they have photo booths for portfolio
photos and head shot. and it's actually
something that they typically do because
people need these head shot. Um, so that
is also something that that can be done.
Um, and then of course there's AI. Uh, I
have noticed there are a ton of AI
platforms that craft one beautiful
photograph through AI. Uh all you have
to do is compile
six to eight photographs that are nice
clean photographs of yourself and then
they will kind of I don't know you guys
tell me what they do. What's the
technical term? I say they smoosh it all
together and they give you an amazing
professional photograph. So um there are
some outlets out there about that. Um,
anyone have any questions?
Photograph.
And now the banner image. So banner
image and um con uh sorry contact info.
We're going to talk a little bit
together. Um because it's sort of in the
same edit
box.
So why
what is the banner, right? And why does
it help? Seems a little like what do I
do with this thing, right? I I have that
problem all the time. But I it's visual
branding and your you know profile
differentiation.
So it it's the largest graphic on on
your your LinkedIn profile. So you know
don't leave it out. Uh there are options
as well for coming up with the design of
your uh banner image.
there. You could do branded tech
banners,
GitHub, code, newbie, and and maybe even
think of of asking Dr. Emily um about
the TechJoy branding. Maybe she would be
into that since you are all in the the
program right now. Um might make sense.
Uh but of course, ask permission first.
There's also perhaps personal project
screenshots that you may have that that
you're proud of, code snippets, a city
skyline,
um you know, whatever speaks to you and
what feels
is your brand because again that is the
LinkedIn profile. Um, and yes, Glenn,
exactly. The banner uh is the largest
graphic on the LinkedIn uh on your
LinkedIn profile. So, uh feel free to
keep it professional. Um maybe it's the
city or town that you live in. Maybe you
know you're highlighting that. Um Canva
templates. There are quite a bit of
templates for LinkedIn banners on Canva.
You can just search LinkedIn banner and
it comes up with a bunch of them. Uh
project screenshots or UI elements, code
snippets, IDE backgrounds, cityscape,
ads, abstract tech imagery, or you know
a personal branding or a quote,
something simple and clean.
Uh again that speaks to your brand.
Does that make sense to everyone?
Is this is this new? Is this foreign
information?
All right. So now is when we get into a
little bit of a deeper topic. So this is
uh our headline deep dive.
So what the headline does and believe it
or not why it's so important it's
searchable your headline
very important. Um it's highly visible
and it it defines your narrative.
So what what is a headline? It's your
elevator pitch. It's searchable. It's
often the only thing people see before
clicking. Your headline should answer
who you are, what you do, and what's
unique about you. Hard skills and soft
skills. So,
a example
of a formula,
I'm going to put it in the show.
So this is an example.
And now the title
can be in the middle. It doesn't have to
follow this exact structure,
but somewhere in this headline, you want
to have your role or identity,
skills and tools, and then what you're
excited about. I oftentimes just refer
that to soft skills. So
let please allow me to use myself
as an example.
Here I am. Okay.
Sharing my screen.
All right.
All right. Can everyone see my profile?
Good.
All right.
Here's my
banner.
Little artistic flare
and my profile photograph. If I've got
my head shot,
I do have open to work because I am
looking for more consulting work to add
to my plate. Uh, a little bit more of a
side hustle. So, I do have the open to
work on there. Now, here's my name.
You can opt to identify. It's certainly
not something you have to do. Here
is my headline.
Recruitment leader, career coach, tech,
corporate and creative hiring,
DEI advocate
and connector of people and purpose.
Now, I have a few variations that I have
come up with that I've been playing
around a couple of options.
Um, let's see. Um, tech recruitment
leader,
career coach, building teams across
engineering, product and creative,
advocate for equality,
equity, and access.
Sounds like me.
My other option is emphasizing strategy
and a little bit more of a human-
centered hiring.
So, this one came out recruitment
strategist,
career coach, talent partner for high
growth tech and creative teams,
purpose-driven and people first. So, why
why it works? It appeals to startups and
growth stage companies.
And
you know it speaks to any organization
that is looking for a strategic partner
in hiring.
And my third option is more um
highlights more breadth and
adaptability.
So I came up with full cycle talent
leader, tech, corporate and creative
hiring, career coach, DEI champion, and
connecting bold thinkers to big
missions.
So for the next 10 minutes,
I would like you all to come up with
three different options
for your headline.
So look at your current headline
and come up with three other options.
and let me know if you have any
questions.
Okay, one more minute.
All right. So,
who would like to uh share what they
came up with?
Oh, who did that?
Okay, Glenn. Nice.
Full stack developer. React NXJS
TypeScript. Okay. Yep. Docker delivering
user centered scalable applications. I
love it.
Beautiful.
Nice.
>> Um
I was going to share just what it's
interesting the conversation that I went
through with AI on this. So, I put in my
what I currently had and I asked for
three alternate versions. And after it
gave them to me, then it said, "Would
you like me to make another three that
are more playful, personality driven to
help you stand out or more recruiter
friendly and keyword heavy to optimize
for searches?" And I was like, "Well, I
would like it for more recruiter
friendly and keyword heavy." And then it
gave me those. And then it says, "Would
you like me to make a few even more
keyword dense ones to maximize recruiter
searches or balance keywords with a
stronger personal value ad angle, which
I opted for the balance keywords because
I felt like I had gone too far to the,
>> you know, it lost all its personality
>> and uh
>> Okay. Some of them because you know what
did
>> I did yours too for funsies." Oh, okay.
Okay. Well, I was going to say, do you
want me just to post what I finally came
up with
>> or?
>> Yeah.
>> No, you tell me what you want
>> and I'll give you I'll give you the the
three options I came up with and you
give me maybe one or two that really
resonated with you.
>> Yeah. So,
obviously I want the keywords in there
um for to be searchable, but I don't
like it to sound too generic, you I
wanted to have personality to it. So I'm
not saying that this is any final
product. These are just the last three
that it'll give me. Full stack software
engineer, React, TypeScript and NodeJS.
Building scalable user centric web apps
collaborative and product driven. At
least the collaborative and product
driven is a little bit to a personality
and not just like
>> you know skill.
>> I like that.
>> Two is full stack developer frontend
react typescript plus backend Node.js JS
Postgress turning complex ideas into
intuitive scalable products. That's a
little I like that a little bit better.
>> Yeah.
>> And uh three is software engineer, full
stack web development specializing in
clean code, seamless user design, and
agile product delivery. Eh, that's still
that's too generic for me. So, I guess I
would go
>> with number two
>> of these three. That's probably what I
would have gone with.
>> I would probably if I if it were mine, I
would I would be leaning toward two as
well. Some of the ones that I had for
you were sort of similar. Full stack
developer, React, Node.js, MongoDB,
eager to build, learn, and ship real
products.
Then um another full stack developer,
collaborative problem solver, passionate
about clean code and intuitive design.
>> Okay.
>> And then because you know the first one
was clear, techfocused and competent.
Other one was more emphasizing teamwork
and UX.
Now this one more product and impact
oriented right? So full stack web
developer building user focused scalable
apps fast learner with a bias for
action.
>> Yeah.
>> I think I still like what two number two
had to say for you and what you were
able to
>> Yeah. So, I'll probably for for now I'll
put that one in there. I just thought it
was really interesting that I mean I
know what AI is capable of, but I just
it it know it knows what we're going
for. You know what I mean? And like even
if you want more personality for it. So,
>> yeah. And you know what? Again, to Dr.
Emily's point that she has been making
quite a bit in some of the videos uh of
her teaching sessions is a the only way
that AI is going to
uh not be friendly to us is if we are
not collaborative with AI.
you know, we really do need to
understand how to utilize this
technology and then work in partnership
with it if we want to get anything out
of it. Um, and and you know, she used
this amazing example
and and she's so right about
GPS who who had the pleasure
of driving
without GPS technology.
>> Map Quest.
>> Yeah. Anyone who maybe is not showing
their screen, maybe raise their hand
with the I mean
what I listen I had the pleasure of
living in California and I moved there
in 1997 and I was there for three years.
I loved it so much. It was like living
in a movie every single day. And I was
also in the service industry. So I did a
lot of catering, did a lot of waiting
tables at some of like Michelin rated
bars and restaurants. And I was
surrounded by celebrities all the time.
But the bane of my existence
living in Los Angeles was driving. And I
thought it was going to be great. I was
so excited. I got a convertible
Cabriolet
just like the movie Valley Girl. I
rode the 110 and the 101 and like I
thought I was
until I had to learn where it was going
and they had this huge book of maps and
I can't remember what it was called
and trying to drive in LA and read a map
at the same time. What?
I literally my boyfriend at the time had
to come and get me no matter where I was
because I had no idea where I was and
then I got lost in Compton and it was
just it was the whole thing. So,
but my point is the technology
didn't prevent us from driving or buying
cars.
We learned how to utilize the technology
and it made our lives better. I know it
it make it makes my life better every
single day. And now not even to drive a
car, but to walk in the city if I'm down
in in in the city or any city that I'm
not familiar with. Gosh, if I go to a
different country, I'm in Rome or Paris,
you use the GPS, right? Yes, Anna.
>> Um, going back to our headlines, um,
mines I did a little different. I didn't
paste in any resume or anything like
that. I tried to give a description of
what I would like to do, which is kind
of different what folks are here doing.
Um,
>> all right. Let's do it.
>> And so, I I told her that I I'm a former
tester. I'm in training for junior
developer, but I want a role where I can
get in there and and just really help in
terms of code maintenance, may add some
code and code itself, but you know, and
I know a lot of this might be what these
code developers do. Um, but a lot of
times in some companies, they're
constantly building things and they
don't have time to go back in that old
code and clean it up. That type of
stuff.
Yeah.
>> Or did you know? So, I wasn't sure what
to say. So, I I gave that to to um chat
GPT to see what it says because I didn't
know I didn't know a description for
that.
>> And it just pretty much said junior
junior developer and trainer, former
software tester, passionate about code
quality and collaboration. That's what
it had. So, I'm like, okay, it's not as
nice as these guys.
>> All right. All right. All right. Hang
on. Okay, let's do this together because
I'm gonna put it in in my AI platform.
So, okay, you you consider yourself a
junior developer.
>> Yeah, in training. In training. Nowhere
near it right now. In training.
>> Okay.
>> Okay.
>> Put my hand down.
Okay.
What is your LinkedIn headline as it
stands now?
>> Um,
I was kind of embarrassed to say that,
but IT professional because I didn't
know what to say.
>> IT professional.
>> That's what it says. IT professional.
>> Okay. No, you know what? Listen, there's
no there's absolutely no shame in the
game. We are all here to support each
other
and you're you're here because you're
looking for something more. And you know
what? Everybody else is. I'm here to
help. And you know what? I'm looking for
something more, too. And I'm learning
from all of you. I can't tell you how
blown away I was by some of the videos
that I've been watching with Dr. Emily,
I today is a day where I am feeling so
blessed that I have this opportunity to
work with all of you because I am it's
going to make me a better recruiter. So,
no no embarrassment.
No embarrassment at all. We're all in
the same place.
All right.
Okay. What else did you say that you put
into
chat GBT on your end.
>> Just the three former tester
current former
>> former former
um software tester
>> currently a a training for junior
developer
and then what else did I put? I
>> go back to chat.
>> All right. Nice. Okay.
>> I see.
>> Where do you want to be?
>> What's the dream?
>> What's the dream job?
>> I just put in I want to work with a
group or company that allows me to look
at code to for for to to for maintenance
and to add to it and also to to do other
development roles.
I don't know if that make any but that's
>> is it low code that you're looking for?
Are you looking to be more stack?
>> No, I want stack. Um,
>> okay.
>> I don't know if there's a a degree or if
it's if you're all in or if you're all
out. I don't want to be in stack to a
point where it's high stressed. So,
that's why I want roles that's lower
stressed where can still do development,
but it's not all this pressure on your
back. working as a tester for years, I
watched
>> um developers on certain projects
literally age prematurely.
>> So, I don't want that.
>> Okay. Colleagues, friends, co-workers,
>> what what other suggestions
uh would you lend to Anna as support?
like what would you
>> I don't know what titles what's out
there that can you know I think these
things are kind of like embedded in
these organization there's may not be
official name for it so I figure if I
get my door in as a junior developer um
and maybe that's the route to go right
now to say you know I'm working both
front end and backend
>> development
um what is your What? What qualities?
Soft skill qualities. Not hard coding
skills. I know Microsoft Word, Microsoft
Office, I can use PowerPoint, Keynote.
Not the hard skills. What are the soft
skills that highlight you that you are
most proud of about yourself? Well, I
can give you what I am as a when I as a
tester because you can't you can't you
know like I'm relaxed with this school
but as a tester you have to be on your
game
>> and you got to understand so in that
case you have to be focused you have to
be
um very detailed you know and you know
get familiar with the system you know
get to understand the culture Get to
understand the expectation of that
product. Get to understand what they see
as oh more important what's not as
important so important. It might be an
issue but it might be like a very low
level. So you know yes we know it's
there. It's documented but just focus on
the stuff that's really more critical.
So it's that type of thing is it's
really going off of what are the
priorities
for that product or for that test or
whatever.
And also the way I was trained as a
tester, things kind of change now is
that um you know you have product owners
and so when you build a product you know
from the the perspective that I was on
was just validating that the
functionality that was being brought in
was correct and also that it was um user
friendly intuitively. Um but when you
build a product, it should go off of
what the the the owner wants and not
just what you want. And that's how I was
trained.
>> Okay.
>> Okay. All right.
Okay. I'm going to tell you what I came
up with.
Okay.
Okay. Option one. And this is all this
is a group hope. Yes.
>> Um what I thought about Anna or I think
about Anna is that she's collaborative.
She really is a team player and she can
stay on she's focused. She can stay on
task and not get off into the weeds. You
know, if you're if you're doing
something, she she's really in there.
She's all in. And I think she's also I
think she can easily say she's a
seasoned professional.
I I don't know how else to put that, but
you know, that's Yeah,
>> that's what I think.
>> Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you very
much. Um Anna this is what I've come up
with. So option one is more focused
within bridging QA and development.
Full stack developer
former software tester detail oriented
adaptive and driven to build.
It shows
>> copy and paste this.
>> Sure.
>> Oh that's why it's like whoa.
Yeah, I'll copy and paste it for you.
So, it it shows your QA foundation,
you know, a plus in DevOss
there. You know, it's attention to
detail and eagerness to grow. Now we
have option two. Human censored
versatile
developer and training tech savvy
intuitive and cultured driven from
testing to building great products.
Speaks to your career evolution while
highlighting emotional intelligence
and team culture value.
I like it now.
Um,
clear uh more of a clear value
proposition.
Aspiring full stack developer,
precision focused with QA mindset,
collaborative, quick to pivot, and
always learning. That's That's my
choice.
That I was feeling that.
>> I like all three.
>> Yeah.
>> You know what it is? I found with a lot
of these AI platforms to really um
Did someone just join?
Anyway, um I find that you really have
to be very specific
and almost give AI like too much and
then I'll I rather take away than add
>> and I did I've been doing that quite a
bit with some of the queries and prompts
and I've been reading a lot about how to
prompt.
So, let me get
let me put this in the chat for you.
Okay, there's that. Now, what I do want
to do
>> is Oh, say is here. All right. Now, what
I would like to do is just rewind and go
back to Jasmina has some beautiful ones.
Let's let's go through that. Um Key was
in the other session and she came out
with a few. We've got 10 minutes, but I
would like to quickly um go through some
of these because ah I started with Glenn
and I didn't finish and I wanted to do
that because he had some really nice uh
curated headlines. Um, so full stack
developer react nextjs typescript
I don't know how you would say this but
postgreql
is that the proper
yeah works okay
>> it'll work I don't know how to pronounce
it either I think it's postgress or
something like that postgresql
>> excellent excellent excellent so
delivering user center scalable
applications
Perfect. Wonderful. Number two, full
stack developer re
crafting clean suitable web apps with
React Nex.js
and postgreql
built for how people work. Boom. Mic.
>> I like that one best of the three
actually.
>> Oh, too. Um I I mean
let's go.
Let's go. I love it. And then even the
last one I like too.
Full stack developer, React, TypeScript,
Prisma, agile contributor focused on
clarity, collaboration, and continuous
learning.
>> Yeah, I think two and three add more
personality. Other one's just really
dry. It's just
>> Yeah, you know.
>> Yeah, you can play around with this,
right? So, um,
now let me see
next. Yes, Thomas Guide Kai, thank you.
That it really did me in driving in
California with that stupid
map,
bulk of maps. And um,
let's get three different headline
options. All right. Yeah, Glenn went
through kind of explained
what he did.
Key, so Keyi was in the session at at
noon um and she had some beautiful
submissions, but you know, it looks like
she's um using IIA, she's come up with a
few different ones from this morning.
Full stack developer, React, Nex.js, JS
Typescript supportive teammate and peer
mentor empowering team problem solving
and building meaningful power focused
solutions.
Talk about it.
I love it.
Key, you are bringing it
to both sessions. I love it. Yeah.
Katrina met with me after and was like,
"Hey, you should mention that you're a
pure mentor and leading people.
I love that about Katrina. She just
keeps me honest every second of the day
without knowing that I need her to keep
me honest. I love her so much.
She brings out the best in everyone and
makes you think. I am so blessed to have
her as as one of my partners.
Um yeah, she I I like that. Uh Katrina,
um I really love this specifically. I
mean, I don't know if you want to play
with that a little bit more. And again,
we're evolving evolving our LinkedIn
profile and our resume forever more. But
this is this is nice. I like this. Thank
you very much for sharing.
Um, Jasmina. Okay. Technical business
analyst, data and integration expert,
passionate AI learner, bridging tech
strategy and emerging innovation,
goosebumps.
I love that.
>> Um, really nice.
>> So, which one did you like the most of
these uh three? I'm sorry. You know, I
just I read only one and got goosebumps.
But let's let's read more. Business
analyst with dev experience, AI and
datadriven problem solver learning and
applying emergent tech to improve
systems.
Beautiful techsavvy business analyst
building AI skills solving business and
cyber challenges with data
dev and continuous learning.
Personally,
I'm vibing with one and three. I would
maybe play around with those and see
what else you can come up with.
>> I'm I'm sorry to bother you again, but
the next text is like improved for
searching. That's what Chad GPD gave me.
I like it.
Uh I think I like number three the most
because
>> the one thing with the prompts in AI
that I have found is I always have to
ask AI to not sound robotic
but
bring warmth
and friendliness
and I feel like that gives me a nice
balance.
Because sometimes it can be like like
okay thank you AI but I need you to
sound more like a human being and less
like
a recruiter.
>> You're not.
>> So I would play around with those
prompts. But yeah, I actually enjoy the
first set.
>> Okay,
>> they're they're like, yeah, these are
great. And then what else we got?
>> Thank you very much.
>> Okay.
All right, Glenn.
Full stack developer rules. If we
present ourselves as junior dev, I think
that based on what we heard in these
zoom sessions, we are virtually recluded
from consideration.
Um, you know that really, how
however
you wish,
this is answering Glenn Buyers. However
you wish to present yourself and and I I
honestly think from listening to some of
Dr. Emiline's uh coaching videos.
So many of the open roles
to apply to are not junior, but they're
more mid and senior. And I think it
really depends on where meeting yourself
where you're at. Like what what level
are you? And you know, sometimes you've
got to fake it till you make it.
Hand to God.
Fake till you make it. I have done it my
entire career.
I had no idea what a recruiter was when
I was hired to be one. No clue.
But I was told because I was a bartender
and somo and waited tables in Michelin
rated restaurants and was personal
assistant to celebrities that I could
handle this job without a problem.
>> Okay.
>> Transferable skills.
>> You know what? Honestly, I'm just a
hustler. But here I am 20 years later.
Um and
and Yes. And yet your training uh you
will have the best training coming out
of this program. And the reason why I
know that to be fact is because the
there's metrics.
There are pe there are perfect examples
of people who have left
with a three figure salary.
So it's gonna happen to all of you,
right? So that's just that's that's it.
Glenn, how can I help you?
>> Well, no, I just regarding the whole
chat GPT prompt thing. Um, some of us
already understand this, but it's
important to have a conversation with
chat GP GPT. Give it a context. Say, I'm
trying to get this role. I can do this.
It needs to appeal to this crowd. How do
I make that work? And then ask it more
questions like you do with a real
person. And then the other thing is like
what I did, I dumped in my headline and
my resume. Say, okay, based on this and
my resume, give me a headline that will,
you know, do XYZ and then tweak it from
there. Uh, you don't just ask it one
question and hope for the best. You have
to kind of ask it questions and refining
questions and refining questions till
you finally get to where you want to be.
It's not all going to be one shot.
Yeah, AI likes to um
they def I a AI definitely likes to be
massaged
and courted and dated.
They like to AI likes to be winded and
dined.
Yeah.
Yeah. Um so I've got
I think We're we are almost at time but
to Yes. Kai
>> um uh is what happens or is there any
like issue with looking at other
people's profiles and saying
I like that. I'll take that.
>> No.
>> No. Do it.
>> Yeah. This is the
>> you know the old coders adage. this code
you wrote is good. Code you stole is
great. So, you know,
so yeah,
>> there you go.
>> Is does that sort of play into any sort
of algorithm from a search standpoint?
>> I I the headlines are searchable. Know
that. And you that is a part of the
search. So when recruiters are sourcing
on LinkedIn and they're putting in their
keywords and structuring their uh search
criteria,
that headline is part of that search
criteria,
which is why we want to get real
specific
and we really want to be thoughtful with
that headline.
And again, it's
it's a it's a very saturated job market
and we want to stand out. Jasmina, no
problem. Thank you. We we do want to
stand out.
You all of you already have
such a leg up more than a lot of people
on the job market right now because you
are being trained by someone who is the
in the best of her like the sweetest
part of her her career like Dr. Emily
knows what she's doing and she's got
metrics to to back it up.
So you all of you already have an
advantage. Now it's just about putting
the sweet. It's about putting the
frosting on the top, getting that
cherry, putting it on the top, little
bit of fluff, maybe some Nutella, you
know, like really bringing
yourself to life. The best pop. Yes,
Timothy, I love cupcakes. Thank you.
But it's really just about
adding the detail,
constructing your identity and your
brand and how you present yourself. It's
all these little steps, right?
So you know we don't want to hear
aspiring developer looking for
opportunities
or you know we want to see front-end
developer react CSS building responsible
web apps with care
something that's like
recent boot camp grad. No.
No.
Yeah. Make your own opportunities,
Timothy. That's right. It's what you do.
And you'll be all of you will be noticed
100%.
You know, it's
full stack developer, JavaScript,
Express, build three, real, real world
apps and counting.
I honestly like all of yours a little
bit better.
Um,
so
please think about this. Think about
adding a nice polished photo,
a banner, contact information. Make sure
your email address is there,
your LinkedIn, the link to your LinkedIn
profile, no phone number, no address.
There's too many scammers out there. And
nobody needs that personal information.
There's no need for that. They can have
it when they hire you. How about that?
That's the information that they can
get. That's the present they get.
Um
maybe think about digging in a little
bit more with your versions. Do a little
bit more of an exploratory in any you
know the AI platform of your choosing
and you and any anyone else uh you know
should
exchange these ideas with each other.
No Batman t-shirt. Sam,
>> please.
>> I don't see anything wrong with
leveraging off one another or being
inspired and just tailor yours to you.
>> Absolutely. Um, how many sections are
there on your LinkedIn profile to
update, modify that contribute to your
search ability? Um,
let me see. Uh, you know, everything is
searchable to be honest. uh Kai
um the headlines
uh even the open to work you can search
in LinkedIn based on finding people who
say they're open to work um and if if
they're only looking for remote hybrid
or if you're only looking for an on-site
uh job
you can search the about section
And then of course your experience,
education,
uh all of your education, your skills.
You can also search
um
anyone from a certain university from
certain years or if you've been at a
certain organization
for a certain amount of years or during
a certain 2010 to 2011. Maybe you're
only looking for uh software engineers
who
uh were
working with
OpenAI from
2016 to 2017. I don't know. Just
throwing it out there. You can search
that way as well. Does open to work
jeopardize your current job? Only if
uh well, here's the thing. when you post
your that you are open to work
and you are looking um
if I would not put the open to work
banner
on your profile,
but
I would list that you are open to work.
Individuals who are currently at your
company will not be able to see that.
>> Where would I put open to work?
>> You said don't don't use the banner but
put us put it somewhere else.
>> It I believe it's when you are let me go
to my profile. When you're on your
profile and you are
editing
the top portion.
>> Okay.
>> So, This is the portion your photograph,
your banner, your headline, your name.
Underneath where it says how many
connections you have, you should be able
to opt in when you edit that or even not
editing, you can option to put open to.
>> Yeah.
>> And that's the beauty of it. Individuals
at your current company will not be able
they will be blocked from seeing
that you have posted you are open to
work. I do not believe
I I believe that they will be able to
see your open to work banner.
>> Yeah. Yeah. That's why I asked because I
I knew they could see that. I just
didn't want to advertise and have them
come to me. Hey, what are you doing?
Exactly.
>> So, we are eight minutes over time. Does
anyone have any last minute questions?
And was this helpful?
>> Yeah. If it's crap
to tell me
>> I need all of you to tell.
>> Yeah. I learn something every time I
come to these. So, this is fantastic.
Okay. Awesome. Awesome. And I'm just
trying to give you guys inside scoop
because
and and I'm not I am not tooting my own
horn at all, but I'm a different
recruiter
than you will probably uh come up
against. I don't want to say I'm up
against, but
I'm a more casual
um very transparent,
very like let's just be real and human
with each other and get down and dirty
and talk about what what we're we're
doing here.
I'm very focused as a recruiter to
anyone that I schedule that I hunt for,
that I connect with, that I schedule
time to speak to,
I'm I'm getting in the dirty details.
I really am because and and you know
what? If you're if your salary band is
too low, I'm gonna let you know. Like,
listen, you're you're doing yourself a
disservice.
If your if the salary band on the job or
if your salary band is higher than the
salary band listed in the position, I'll
let you know. Hey, you're 10 you're 10
grand higher than the top of the band.
Can you believe be flexible?
What if I told you that the hiring
manager is just chef's kiss?
Do you want to at least have a
discussion? Because maybe
this is the culture that you're looking
for and in a and also I'll help you
understand
why coming at the top of the band in a
salary is going to do you a disservice
because the next year when there are
comprehensive reviews, guess what?
You're not getting raise because you've
already hit the top of the band.
So ideally, you want to come into a
position not hitting a glass ceiling
because you want to grow.
And PS, like I know money is very
important now more than ever, but you
know what's more important? Not going to
work and working with jerks.
Like, is it the opportunity that you
want?
Is this the culture that you that you
want to be in? Is this going to allow
you to reach your goals, your own
personal goals? Yes. Anna,
sorry.
>> Anna, your hands raised.
>> Oh, I'm sorry. I My mic on my headset
was muted.
forgive me.
Um, but it does it strikes a memory or
struck a memory of where I worked at if
this one guy he was like a business
analyst and he was there for a long time
and um then we didn't see him and then
we found out with company restructuring
they kind of let go people that were
they're so long they were making more
than the managers. Is that even
possible?
But it just struck a memory just saying,
you know, I guess you just don't know
what can happen.
>> Well, yeah, it does happen all the time.
Um, and I've seen it happen because and
and sometimes with recruiters,
part of our our job is to
make sure that we are keeping internal
equity in mind, right? I mean equity in
general to me
is a top priority, but what I mean by
internal equity is individuals that you
already have on a team that have been at
a company for, let's say, five to six
years. They've been chugging away.
Let's say Anna, you're highest in the
group. You're at 150K.
You're a senior business analyst, let's
say.
>> Dun,
and you're interviewing John
and
he wants 160K. That's where he wants to
be. And you know what? Maybe the salary
band funding wise per finance goes up to
175. And John has some amazing
experience
above and beyond what the job
description calls for, but he's really
eager to move to this company because
it's got such an amazing reputation and
he sees more growth in the long run, but
he doesn't want to go backward in
salary. He's already at 160, so he's
making a lateral move.
That's
a curated conversation
by the recruiter. And that's a hard one
because then I have to go back to John
and say, "John, we really want to hire
you. We want to make you an offer, but
here's the deal. We can't offer you
160."
And here's the reason why.
Internal equity. We respect it and we
play pay close attention to it. These
are background discussions that happen
that most people don't know about,
but it's just I'm telling you this to
give you
thinking for when you approach these
discussions.
And I think that sometimes it's about
the opportunity and maybe maybe you have
to go back 10K. It happens sometimes.
And maybe you have to say, you know
what,
I can't I can't go back in salary. I
love this place. I would love to accept
this position, but I need to sit stick
to 160.
But
just understanding that
sometimes also recruiters don't have
those discussions. I do because I need
people to understand what's going on.
It's their right. I've pestered them.
I've asked them to
shift their day and schedule time.
They've craft they've carved time out of
their lives.
So, it's a mutual respect thing.
But now we're 15 minutes over time. So,
everyone, thank you so so much for your
time. I'm so
I I'm so blessed to have the opportunity
to work with all of you. If you have any
questions, please do not hesitate to
reach out. As a reminder, I am
fast and furious Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, and all yours on those three
days. Thursday, Friday, I kind of peek
my head in and check Discord. So, if I'm
a little bit slower, Thursday, Friday,
Saturday, Sunday,
it's because those are sort of my off
days. They're days that I uh put in some
hours for Dr. Emily. Um, but I am
around.
Have an amazing evening and I hope you
found all of this helpful.
>> Is it easy to find you on Discord to
send a friend?
Yes.
>> I think just
>> I think that was just Chelsea Scott. I
don't know.
>> Okay.
>> I've had a hard
>> make it easy.
>> I do not get along.
Um I am Chelsea though, so you can find
me as Chelsea.
>> Okay, sounds good.
>> All right, have a great night everyone.
>> Thank you.
>> Thank you, Chelsea.
