https://youtu.be/E6zkcdNbn0A

Hey,
good.
Keep that on for right now.
Oops.
I can do nothing.
It will not show up. I'll give it 15
minutes.
Hey Leo, how's it going?
>> Hey, it's going good. It's going good.
>> Good. Welcome.
I'll just uh hang out for um a couple
more minutes. You usually give it uh
till like 5 after, sometimes 10 after.
We'll see. So, feel free to keep your
screen off and we'll wait a little bit
for some more people to arrive.
>> All right, sounds good.
>> Thanks.
Hello there. We're just waiting for a
couple other people to join. So, feel
free to hang out and I'll be with you in
a few minutes.
All right.
So, we've got a couple of people that
are here. So, I am going to start
talking about the job hunt.
And we are on week 12. So, some of you
um well, I know for sure, Lisa and Leo,
you've been pretty consistent
um on this. I don't know, BB. I don't
know your real name. I'm sorry. Um but
throw it in the chat so that I can uh
call you by your name. Uh but welcome.
Thanks so much for joining. Um, so we've
been doing quite a bit uh over the past
11 uh or so weeks and it has really been
a sprint reviewing and tackling
LinkedIn
and um you know building your LinkedIn
presence from the ground up. So, you
know, each week
uh had purpose and every part connects
to how recruiters find and evaluate you.
Um, now
lost my spot.
Um,
so let's quickly walk through what we've
covered. All right. So, this is um a
brief recap. So, we talked about why
LinkedIn matters. We went from top to
bottom, from the profile basics, photo,
headline, banner to crafting a
compelling summary. We did quite a bit
of um highlighting as well, highlighting
our skills, projects, education,
uh custom URL and settings, building
your network. We had that as a part one
and part two. So part one was connecting
um and sending invites and then part two
was keeping those relationships warm and
authentic. We talked about messaging and
outreach and followed that up with
asking for writing recommend asking for
and writing recommendations
as well as posting content using
hashtags and then running through the
job alerts filters and search tools.
Now, if you missed a couple of these
sessions, I encourage you to check out
all of the recordings of the sessions.
if you missed anything. Each session
goes through things in great detail. Um,
tonight we're bringing it all together
and we'll focus on making your profile
fully optimized and recruiter ready
because next week we are going to be
starting our resume series. And just
like our LinkedIn series, we will be
going and starting from top to bottom.
Uh, I know Leo, Lisa, we've both met um
independently for a session and I edited
your
um I edited your
um
uh edited your resume. So that was uh
you know something that we did and um we
are continuing doing that uh with our
resumes and then you can do that all on
your own. So here we go. Um now
tonight we are going to start with
talking about how recruiters actually
use LinkedIn to find candidates. And
this is going to be um you know talking
a little bit about and and it's sort of
a red because I did talk about this for
a few couple of weeks the last two
weeks. So recruiters use boolean
searches to filter candidates
and you know profiles with complete
information rank higher in these
searches. So engagement and activity
also boost visibility. So in a couple of
weeks ago, we talked about posting and
maybe reposting something that you saw
that piqu your interest that is in
alignment with coding and the job hunt.
Uh so those are things that you can act
those things are actually s searchable
as as well. So when people post articles
those not so much the articles but if
you put hashtags
uh include hashtags in those posts they
are searchable as well. So,
the um example of a recruiter style
search ring,
post one in the chat right now, gives
you an idea of how recruiters do source
for talent. And this is a great example
of a boolean search. And please confirm
that you receive this.
Everyone received this. You can just nod
your head.
Yeah. Did you see this in the chat?
Yeah. No.
Can you see that, Leo?
Yeah. Okay, cool. Um, a key let me know
that sometimes when I'm posting in the
chat, it's not showing. So, I just want
to make sure.
um this is a boolean search. So if I
were given a position for a full stack
developer
and they needed to know JavaScript
or React or Node and
SQL or a you know AWS API
um uh
or PostgresQL.
This is the way that I would search for
this if I were a recruiter. So, this is
just kind of giving you an idea.
So, my question to you is
what would make your profile appear in
this search? So, what I suggest for this
session is having your LinkedIn profile
up so that you can review your LinkedIn
profile live while I'm asking you these
questions.
And and what I mean by this is
your headline should read full stack
developer
or you could have software engineer in
there if that is what type of role
you're looking for. Now Lisa, I know
that we've worked together and you were
looking, you know, actively uh on the
immediate front for QA positions. So
somewhere in your headline
there should be quality assurance
like it should say something and it'll
say definitely some of that uh it will
say QA or quality assurance because you
have that listed as some of your
previous positions but it should also be
listed in your uh as part of your
headline as well as your skills. Right?
So keywords,
skills, activity, the people that you're
connecting with should be holding
some of those titles or there are folks
that are hiring for those types of
roles.
Now
let's talk a little bit more and it will
be a bit of a more review
on this sort of profile and deep dive.
Okay. So again, starting from the top,
your photo and banner. Now, you should
again have your LinkedIn profile up and
you're looking at this and you're
analyzing this. Now, the profile and
banner,
is your image professional and clear?
Do you have a professional image or a
professional photograph? Does your
banner represent your field?
Okay. The headline,
does it state your role,
specialty
or target position?
These are things to think about. Okay.
About
summary section. Does it tell your story
clearly in two to three short
paragraphs?
Experience and projects.
Are your projects explained
with outcomes
or tools used? Now, I know that some of
the students in um the uh TechJoy
Academy, they're in different phases of
the program. Some of you have tackled
projects
uh and some of you have not. When you
work on projects and when you've
completed a project and it's been
produced,
that is the time to list that on your
resume
as well as on LinkedIn,
no sooner. And you have to make sure
that you're asking for permission to
post it and making sure again that it is
a produced work.
Okay.
Now, skills. Are your top 10 skills
relevant to jobs you're applying for?
Recommendations. Do you have at least
one or two recommendations?
So, this is what you should have
um completed as you start your job
search.
I'm going to copy and paste this in the
comments here.
um because that is really important
and don't get overwhelmed with it. Take
it in segments.
Start with the photo and the banner.
Now again like I mentioned some of you
are in different phases but what I would
like to do is take 10 minutes
for each of you to pick one section to
improve tonight
and update it live right now.
Okay,
Anna's joining us again.
Hey Anna, welcome. We are running
through the review from last night and I
see Michelle is jumping on too.
So that'll be nice for the both of you
to have a little bit of a review. Hey
Michelle,
I was just letting Anna know that I am
doing a little bit review of last night
to allow everyone to sort of catch up.
I'm going to give
everyone 5 to 10 minutes to do the same
exercise that we did last night. So, you
know, take a look
at your LinkedIn profile. So, make sure
you have those up
and pick one section to improve tonight.
So, let's do that live right now. We'll
take
let's say five minutes this time because
we have a good amount to cover. And now
real quick, common mistakes to avoid
keyword stuffing and vague summaries if
you're going to tackle your summary.
And again, you can do it with the help
of AI as well. Claude, Chat, GPT,
whichever platform you prefer
can help you with this.
Incomplete project descriptions, not
showing measurable results,
neglecting a banner or a headline
altogether,
no good. Those are things to avoid.
Every section should work together to
tell the story of where you're headed
next.
So take some time
and
work on that for 5 to 10 minutes.
>> Sorry we were late.
>> No problem at all.
Okay, I have to ask this
um because I haven't been out here to um
LinkedIn in a while. Um when you say
headline
and then the summary.
>> Yep.
>> Um
like I have on here on mines I have an
about and that was up
>> the same thing.
>> Okay.
>> It's the same as the summary. See in the
listing uh in the bullets it says about
slash summary. So it can be you know
>> Oh okay. Okay, I just saw a summary.
>> All right, so I think that one's
updated. Then the headline then that's
the one when you have your
>> your your descriptions like strategic
for what type of roles you want to do or
whatever. That's that section, right?
That's your
>> I'll uh let me uh I'll pull up my
LinkedIn profile to go over this one
more time. Um but definitely encourage
all of you to review the
um some of the videos the pre-recording
or the recorded sessions.
>> Yeah,
>> it's a little slow. So
let me share my screen.
Okay.
So, oh, you know when you see my screen,
it's just very slow.
Can you all see my screen?
>> Yes, I can.
>> Okay. This is the banner.
This
is my profile picture.
Okay.
All right, just
do this. The headline.
This.
>> Okay, that's what I thought. Okay,
>> that is the headline.
>> Okay, I just got to figure out how to
get mine displayed. I put something
somewhere. I thought that was it and the
only thing it's showing is IT
professional. So, I got to click around
it.
>> So, see, you make your edits here.
This is where you edit some of that
information and it'll go through
everything. You put in your basic info.
You put in how you identify if you so
choose. Here is where you do your
banner. You can write it with AI. Here I
recommend you know doing you can do it
with chat GPT as well.
This is your current position
where the industry that you're in,
education,
your location.
Contact info you can edit here if you'd
like.
I have my
URL that I custom made.
This is my email address. I put my email
address for my current position because
people are reaching out to me because
I'm recruiting for um Renewity Home. I
personally do not list my phone number.
I personally though as a recruiter it
would be super handy if talent listed
their phone numbers but in this digital
world I do not feel that it's advisable
or I've I've had my identity I've had
identity theft so I really put out as
little information about myself as
possible. I do not put my address. I do
not put my birthday.
When all of you have a personal website
showcasing
the projects that you've produced and
worked on, this is where I would list
that on your website and you save all of
that information.
>> Okay. I'm assuming that you're
subscribed with LinkedIn.
>> Do you mean do I have a membership?
>> Yeah, like that premium thing.
>> I do. I do. Okay.
>> Yeah. And I if you are actively and
seriously looking for a position,
especially in tech,
low code or full stack software
development, highly recommend because
you're not going to be visible to
employers if you don't. And it it it
really I mean I I tried to work with it
uh with LinkedIn without premium and
it was a waste
and that's the honest truth.
>> Premium.
>> It's about $250 for the year.
>> I almost said a heart attack. I thought
you were going to say a month.
No, I if it was I couldn't do it either.
Um, and now
you can
customize things with these buttons
here. It's a little too complicated for
me. Um, I put what I'm open to and it
will post it here.
Here is your about section.
Right.
Does it tell your story clearly in two
to three short paragraphs?
Um,
and then from
the skills
that you list for each role that you've
had.
It typically always lists it here.
Shows my activity.
Some of the reposts that I've done,
mainly things that I repost are jobs
that my colleagues at other agencies are
recruiting for. I know a lot of people,
so um I always hope that people have
visibility.
And then of course you list these roles.
I have to actually do let edit.
Um,
here we go.
Do an edit here.
We can do it in real time. So, I guess
if I were given the exercise that I just
gave all of you,
I'd be adding some skills here. Let me
see.
Um,
retail.
Okay.
I have retail recruitment.
Oops.
Sales.
Sales recruitment.
And I guess I'll just put retail,
corporate recruiting,
and that's what I'll put for now. Notice
that I forgot that, but that's where you
know you can do that. And it's making
sure that you have added that piece.
Skills are pretty important for each
role.
So, so let me get this straight. You
don't put your phone number on because
of people hacking your account. You said
>> I mean I if you list I I mean there's no
sense in
listing your phone number and email
address. Those are two piece critical
pieces of information that people use
to
hack into anything or steal your
identity. I'm just sensitive.
>> Yeah, I'm sensitive to that because I've
had my identity stolen and all they had
was a phone number and email address.
From those two pieces of information,
they were able to get my social security
number and take out a loan on a home
that I did not own.
>> So,
>> wow.
>> It's it's that kind of thing. So, you
don't I mean, nobody's that desperate
here. Let's, you know, you've got a, you
know, they have your having your email
address is just fine and they will
message you and you can respond to them
or they can email you directly. If it's
a good recruiter, they will message you
on LinkedIn and email you if your email
address is correct and listed.
A recruiter will get in touch with you
and they will find a way if they need
to.
So again, here are all of your roles.
Adding your um your skills.
I don't have great detail listed in my
roles. I'm a recruiter. You can tell by
my skills what type of recruiting I've
done.
If I listed everything I did at every
job, it would sound the same because
recruiting is relatively the same. I've
listed my education.
If you uh your education was completed
over
I would say 8 years ago, don't list it.
It's not needed.
And
the world is agist. It is.
And there's nothing that you can do
about it. It's best to just keep things
simple.
I've recruited. I've recruited for a lot
of hiring managers.
Young and snappy is always what they're
looking for.
So
>> you do have to put in your education
though, right? So the years that you
went to school,
>> no you do not. If it is over eight
years,
>> I am advising you to not list it.
>> So wait, we don't have
>> I think I put it in but didn't put
dates.
>> You can put it in, but just don't put
dates.
>> Yeah.
>> Same like me.
>> Yeah.
>> So we don't I have to put in our um how
many years we've been in college or
whatever through
>> No. No.
>> Yeah. cuz I got mines listed to show
that I did have some formal training in
the fields that I worked in, but I don't
have dates.
>> That's fine.
I if if a recruiter or hiring manager
wants more detail around that, they will
ask you and then you can speak to it.
But it's not necessary
when recruiters when you're people are
searching. Sometimes
uh recruiters will filter use filters
for
uh you know maybe entry level like for
instance myself right now I'm hiring a
retail associate in three different
stores
and they're looking for entry level or
folks with anywhere from two to three
years of experience max three years
experience
I one of the filters filters I used in
my LinkedIn search today was entry level
or 2 to 3 years and that's fine because
if a student graduates they're going to
list that that they graduated it's
within the past 8 years but I mean I
would even venture to say anything past
5 years I wouldn't list the date
>> especially in it
>> uh Sure. Yeah. Really? Anything.
>> Um I have my
>> out to me is always some type of senior
test row and I'm getting out of that.
>> Uh yeah. Well, I mean your resume speaks
to that. So it's it's to be expected
that people are going to recruiters will
reach out to you and you don't know. A
recruiter doesn't know what place a
candidate is in their life. For all we
know, Anna, you could have lost your job
yesterday. And you have mouths to feed,
bills to pay.
So, I'm going to take a chance and and
reach out to you. How am I supposed to
know that you're not interested in those
roles anymore? It's part of your
experience,
>> and who knows what your life situation
is. So recruiters, take a chance and
they will reach out to you.
>> I'll just work with AI just to list all
the projects I did so far in this school
and what my current one is and get that
on there. And hopefully because it's the
most recent, it will be like ding ding
ding ding.
>> Yeah. Just make sure that you are
explaining the projects with outcomes
and the tools that you've used.
And they should all be produced
projects.
So just just letting you know because
they will these questions will come up
in
um
technical interviews. Okay. And here the
skills are listed again.
I've got I guess a total of 95. It's
interesting.
I shouldn't have clicked on that, but
here they all are.
And finally,
recommendations.
I'm just trying to get back to that
page. Give me one moment. Here we go.
And then recommendations. I've got 43.
And if you want to read any of them,
feel free to look at my profile. But
again, these recommendations searchable.
Everything on LinkedIn is searchable.
>> I never put it out on LinkedIn, but I
rarely went out to LinkedIn, too. So,
but I can put that out there because I
still have it.
>> Yeah. I mean, I if you're not utilizing
LinkedIn, I I think you're really,
you know, you're shooting yourself in
the foot,
especially in this market. This market
is extremely competitive.
LinkedIn is a way to stand out.
Okay,
where did that go?
Perfect.
>> Let's continue.
Lisa, what did you did you want to say
something?
>> Yes. Can you hear me?
>> Yep.
>> Hello.
>> Um, when you're doing your projects,
when you're doing your projects, is it
okay to do just the LinkedIn uh the link
to the project?
>> No, you need to explain it.
Same with your resume.
>> Okay. So if I was to because I'm
I decided to start refining my
>> programming knowledge
>> and um
I wanted to because I've worked on three
projects on joy of coding and I wanted
to go ahead and put the somebody said
put the link out there but you're saying
add the skill sets that you use like
Typescript and React and those type
>> Okay.
>> Yeah. What does what does that say
everyone? I put it all in the chat and
it's under these bullets. Experience and
projects.
Are your projects explained with
outcomes or tools used?
>> I think that's a gap that I'm missing
that I need to add. So, I need to work
on that one.
>> Yeah. And it should be on your LinkedIn
and resume.
>> Okay. These are things that because your
LinkedIn is really the thing that's
public facing. The resume is private
facing. Both should mirror each other
but be set up in different ways.
>> Okay.
you I I'm I'm listen taking notes and
listening because you my uh views have
increased
>> which great listening to
listening to your knowledge which I
wasn't getting hits and I've gotten that
interview so
um
>> awesome yeah
>> except Victor has to help
>> Victor
>> so thank you I'm listening I'm taking
notes
>> of course Yeah. So, you know, like I
said, every section should work together
to tell the story of where you're headed
next. Yes. It tells the story of what
you've done,
but
your headline should also
talk about what you're doing next.
I
have been a senior recruiter for a
while. I just stepped into the career
coach position. I want to do more of it.
I've done creative recruiting as well as
corporate, but now I'm moving more into
tech and sales and I want more of those
roles. So, I'm going to make sure that
my headline
covers all of that. So, little homework
for you and something for you to think
about as you continue to upgrade your
LinkedIn profile and make those edits.
Review your portfolio from a recruiter's
perspective.
If you are looking for you,
what do you want to see in your LinkedIn
profile?
Step outside of yourself for a moment.
Ask a peer, a couple of other people
that you worked with on these projects
at Joy of Coding,
a friend to give you honest feedback.
a professional colleague uh previous or
current
>> right so
you know we f last night we focused on
on the profile right and and this is the
review that I'm doing now is what we
covered really tonight is more about
talking about movement
right LinkedIn works
when you do. Right? So,
now we need to start now that we've gone
through all of these sessions, now that
we've been digesting all of this,
now it's time to shift the focus on how
to build traction,
make meaningful connections,
and create visibility that leads to
interviews.
connect meaningfully. What does that
even mean? It means
that when you go and apply to a role,
you're then going on LinkedIn,
you're researching, you're in that
search bar up at the top, you're typing
in the name of the company that you just
applied to.
It's going to pull up. You'll be able to
sort through jobs,
people.
Click on those people.
Look and connect with recruiters,
other people with titles that you are
looking for, title that you just applied
to. Connect with those people.
Send them a message. Hey,
I just applied to this role.
Attached is my resume. I'm impressed
with this aspect of your company. I'm
impressed with your company values. I
read this article about what your
company is doing and it attracted me to
this role.
It's not just about applying
in this market especially. It's
saturated. So, you need to figure out
ways to be visible.
Look at the different profiles of people
at the companies that you're targeting.
Look to see if they belong to groups on
LinkedIn. Join those groups.
Repost
some of the articles or things that
really resonate with you. Throw in your
hashtags.
Show people that you're doing the work.
So,
setting up your job search system. We
talked a little bit about that a couple
of weeks ago. Setting up your job
alerts.
LinkedIn notifies you when roles match
your target.
That's
that's critical.
Making sure that those alerts are
alerting you when jobs are
posted within
one to 24 hours. I'd say even 24 hours
is is too late. If you see that a job
has been posted three days ago, don't
bother.
You're wasting your time.
>> Wow.
>> When you see that there are over aundred
candidates that have applied and it was
posted 3 days ago, 2 days ago, one day
ago, don't bother. It's about applying
within that 24-hour period.
Search filters.
Refine and prioritize your search
filters.
Outreach.
Connecting with the right people. Who
are the right people? They are people
who are within the talent acquisition
recruitment function
at companies that you're targeting.
The right people are
folks that maybe are leading teams and
you can tell by
the the titles. you can look through
their profiles and see the positions
that they've held.
Trust me, when people reach out to you
and they're interested in your company
and they've written a meaningful intro,
a LinkedIn request, and attached their
resume with that interest,
and maybe mentioned
an article that the company just
published or someone wrote about them,
those people will
send a if a resume is attached, they'll
forward that resume to the recruiter
that's working on that role. That's how
this all works.
Visibility,
engage,
post,
stay top of mind.
Again, it's about being visible.
So
ask yourself, how often are you checking
your alerts and applying? Do you have
any alerts set?
This is using
LinkedIn to find jobs for you.
This is how you make it work for you.
So the power of this engagement
when you comment on posts from
recruiters or hiring leads
that matters.
And how do you how are you going to do
that? How am I supposed to know who a
recruiter is? You research it. You look
it up.
Plug in the company in the search bar.
Go to people,
find them,
connect with them,
share short updates about projects,
learning wins, or career pro progress.
Lisa, you were just talking about adding
projects on LinkedIn.
You could actually do one better and
post write a post about it.
Include the people that you've you
completed the project with. Say, "Look
at what I've completed. This is a
project I'm really proud of. I did this
at Joy of Coding or Techjoy."
>> Yeah.
>> And I actually did
>> last night. I added one of them to
project. I just uh and I a guy that I
worked with at Sony Ericson
um checked it out and um he works I mean
he works in QA now. He used to be a
developer but now he does software
testing and he actually um he put an
approval or an endorsement.
>> So I I didn't expect that alert. I went
to look at it with on my cell phone and
I'm not seeing the profile but I'm not
seeing the project but I'm amazed how
quickly uh that got endorsed. I was I
was impressed. So
>> yeah. So you know again that visibility
is really important
and you know write a visibility post
that you know you're sharing this week.
do that as an exercise, a project you're
proud of, what you learned from this
uh either this session or another
session that you attended this week, how
you're approaching the job search.
>> So, it could be like anything like a
like I got a couple of coding
playgrounds I've been doing like just to
get my momentum going and learning. So,
it could be that. Okay.
>> Yeah. Yeah. showcasing what you're what
you've done. Absolutely. And it's not
like bragging,
it's talking about and sharing what
you're learning.
>> Demonstrating.
>> And that is a Yeah. demonstrating.
Absolutely. 100%.
Yep. Yep.
>> I just read that uh uh Zuckerberg is uh
paying one. It's a $1 million package to
the top 100
uh
top 100 AI
programmers
or the top 100 uh what is it called?
Yeah, the AI programming.
>> That's pretty package.
>> That's Yeah, I wish I wish I was an AI
AI programmer.
>> Yeah, so do I.
But you know it again strategic outreach
and make it a practice. Every job
application should be paired with
outreach. Keep it short, specific and
friendly.
Hi, I saw your post about the software
developer or the AI developer at Meta.
I'm a developer focused on whatever your
skills are. I'd love to learn more about
what your team is looking for when
hiring for a software developer.
Simple. And
you know, oh, I can't think of that in
the moment. Oh, I've got so much on my
mind. Hello, AI. Chachi PT Claude.
describe what you need it to do and it
will spit out
this little email template that you can
or LinkedIn message template that you
can use for everyone that you're
reaching out to.
>> You can save things in chat GPT. No, you
save it your computer somewhere, right?
>> Uh, no. chat GPT saves what you uh what
you look for. Yeah.
>> Oh, okay.
>> I I used it for thank you letter and I
used the uh the uh description of the
job and the interview.
>> Yeah, it saves your chats. Yeah, I'm
looking at my Chat GPT right now.
>> Okay. I didn't know it did that.
>> And I use chat ch all day, every day. I
mean, just for the search that I was
doing myself, I got handed a retail
associate. I've never hired for a retail
associate.
>> That's insane.
>> I have absolutely no clue.
I mean, I know what a sales associate
does, but I need to be strategic with my
sourcing, right? So, what I do, I said,
very basic. I am a recruiter at Renuity
Home and need to hire a retail
associate.
Hold on one second. It's I am sourcing
on LinkedIn and need some help. What
filters should I be using for this sort
of search? I'm hiring the in the
following locations. Copy and pasted
those locations. How should I start
sourcing for this role? What do people
have in their work history to be retail
associates? Here's the job description.
copy and pasted the job description,
uh, everything, and it spit out some
amazing stuff.
Here's how to structure your LinkedIn
recruiter searched
to find
interesting
history like
every
so
it's
you can use so much
So use chat G TBT
it and use it as a tool
otherwise you know you might not
you will be
>> yeah it's best to use chat GPT because
it would give you a nice professional
summary at least speaking for myself in
a way that I would not have thought of
to write it,
you know, or to
>> to u phrase it. So I um I'm even working
my chat GP TP GBT, excuse me, for this
current um project that I'm working on.
Um and I yeah, a lot of progress with it
because
>> yeah, but word to the wise, right? You
don't want to sound robotic
and you want to research how to utilize
prompts for AI because I can read a
resume. I can read a cover letter. I can
read anything and know they use chat GBT
and copy and pasted it. the M dash,
that's an AI thing and that's a telltale
sign, for instance.
So, be strategic about your prompts
and you know, you do have to edit, make
edits so that it doesn't sound like
it was from chat GPT. It still needs to
sound authentic.
Um, so
you've done the hard part, building the
foundation. Now it's about consistency.
LinkedIn is not a one-time setup.
It's a living tool that works when you
do.
So, final checklist,
profile complete and optimized,
job alerts set, daily engagement plan,
weekly outreach goals. This job market
is tough, but you now have a toolkit
most job seekers never build. Keep
showing up, keep engaging, keep
refining.
The opportunities will come.
You don't need to chase every job.
You need to show up where the right
people are already looking. That's
LinkedIn.
We've got two minutes. Thoughts,
questions, concerns?
Where you said show up where the jobs
are. Where's that?
>> Show up where the right people are.
>> Yeah,
I guess that's different for everybody,
right?
>> It Yeah. Oh, and uh Michelle, by the
way, I spoke with someone today
who has two different LinkedIn profiles.
>> Ah, okay.
>> And she's actually a recruiter.
and she has one LinkedIn profile for a
certain
uh I guess she's an like a an artist.
So, she has that. So, very similar to
you. And then she has a LinkedIn profile
for her
>> um
for her recruiting. And I think like
she uses her
creative name or maybe even uh like I
don't know how you identify for
>> your lighting design. I can put my
company name for my lighting and my
personal name for my coding.
>> Yep. Yep. So, there you have it.
>> That would be very helpful because I I
can't figure out how to make the move.
You know what I mean? And it's like I
have
>> I think you could I think you could, but
you still want to keep both open and
you're one thing you've already built.
You're a success at you've done it.
>> Yeah. Yeah.
>> One, you're stepping into the arena.
>> Yeah. I feel like people show up to my
LinkedIn and go, "Oh, she's distracted.
We don't want her."
>> You know what I mean?
>> Maybe. I mean, I think that if you're a
good recruiter, you're going to take
some time to sift through the profile.
It really depends on the person that's
leading the search.
>> Yeah. See, because both are technical,
you know, both both have programming,
you know, both actually work with
computers, but
>> Y are one's art artistry and one's
>> Y. Wow.
>> Yep. Yep. So, um any questions on dis uh
any questions that you might have, feel
free to reach me on Discord. And if you
need to review these sessions, they are
all recorded and we are going to
um
dive into resumeumés
starting next week.
>> Thank you. You thank you for all the
pointers. It's been
>> You're welcome. change my viewpoint on a
lot of things. And um um I'm going to I
know this is probably a big leap, but
I'm also going to start looking at
like a starter developer position too
with my products since I've done some of
the programming.
>> Listen, try it. Get it out there. Take
the leap. What have you got to lose?
Yeah, I feel a little less u discouraged
looking for a tech job after this
meeting.
>> I mean, it's baby steps. It's baby
steps, you know.
>> She's got she got great ideas
>> and refine and don't get overwhelmed.
Take it from the top bottom, from the B
photo and banner to the headline. just
start chipping away at it.
>> Yeah. Yeah.
>> I guess I'm gonna
>> find the resume and then just backtrack
some with LinkedIn um with mine because
>> like I said before, my mind wasn't with
it this year. I didn't even want a job.
>> I hear you. I hear you. Yes, Michelle.
>> Um does it do any good to have your
students write recommendations? I mean
fellow students are
>> Oh, your fellow students. Absolutely.
Absolutely. Especially if you've worked
with them on pro projects.
>> Yeah.
>> 100%.
>> Alumni,
previous colleagues, current colleagues.
Absolutely 100%.
>> Okay.
>> All right.
>> All right, guys.
>> Everyone have a great night.
>> Thank you.
Bye.
>> Bye.
