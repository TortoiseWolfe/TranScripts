Career Strategy w/ Chelsea - Networking Part 2: Showing Up Authentically (Evening)
https://youtu.be/zPQczjbDQ9Q

All
right,
Sounds like you're muted. There's no
audio coming through.
What does this mean?
>> Hello.
>> Hello everyone. Hey Rodrigo.
>> Hello
Hi, Glenn.
Hello
I will take a few more minutes to see
who else may be joining.
In the meantime,
in the meantime, unless you are driving,
um, I
would love it
if you can turn on your cameras,
everyone. Thank you.
[Music]
Hello everyone. Couple of new faces.
Excellent. Excellent.
Can everyone hear me? Okay.
Yes. Nod. Perfect. Okay. Thank you.
Okay, great. Um, and if humanly
possible, please, unless you're driving,
um, if you all can turn on your camera,
that would be wonderful.
Hey, Alyssa.
Okay, let's do one more minute.
>> All right, so I see we've got some uh
new faces to uh our job hunt session.
Amazing. So nice to see all of you.
old and new faces.
So, thank you. Um,
so since we do have some new faces, I am
going to review what we've been covering
in our sessions both in the evening uh
or in the afternoon. So, at noon every
Tuesday,
uh, Eastern Standard Time as well as 6
PM um, Eastern Standard Time. uh we have
been focusing on LinkedIn.
So week one
we talked about why LinkedIn matters and
its role in today's job search. Second
week we started with the profile basics.
So running through your photo, your
headline, banner, contact info and
headline curation.
Week three, we started crafting a
compelling summary.
Week four, we discussed showcasing our
skills, projects, and education on our
LinkedIn profile.
And week five, we talked about
customizing the LinkedIn URL, contact,
and contact settings.
Now last week we started something that
I think is a very important uh part of
the uh job uh search and is the part two
of applying to jobs and we started
talking about that uh last week. So
building your network and that was part
one. We'll be doing part two this
evening. Um, so
last week with building your network
part one, we talked about who to connect
with and how to personalize your
invites.
And we also drafted and hopefully sent
three real connection requests.
Now,
now what uh we are going to be talking
about is
picking up from uh our last session.
So, this is going to be talking about
showing up authentically on LinkedIn.
Now,
your LinkedIn profile is your
storefront.
How you show up in the feed is how
people see you walking around the
neighborhood, right?
Are you engaged?
Are you visible?
What do you use LinkedIn for? So,
raising your hands can be a virtual hand
or your human paw.
Who here has commented on a LinkedIn
post in the last week?
Okay. Okay. I got a couple people.
Okay. Two.
Okay. So,
all right. Oh, I want to see more hands
next time I ask that question. But this
is a part of networking.
networking
I dare say is more important than the
actual application.
What I have been covering and talking
about and really sort of drove in in the
last session is that
networking is
your way to start engaging with people
and those that you are excited to
possibly you know work with. And you
know, we often think of networking is
about getting a job or asking for
something, but the strongest networks
come from relationships that feel
natural, human, and mutually supportive.
So when you think of networking, what
feelings come up? Excitement, pressure,
awkwardness,
right? So you don't have to wait until
you need something to reach out. That's
what makes it feel transactional. So,
think of it like watering a plant.
If you only water it once a year, it
dies. Small check-ins every few months
are what keeps a connection alive.
Now, in the last session, we talked
about a few of the principles of
relationship nurturing. consistency,
curiosity,
gratitude, value sharing, and we ran
through some examples of genuine
check-ins, right? So, we could take a
couple. Hi, Glenn. Congrats on your
2-year anniversary at company X. How has
your role grown since you started?
It's not, you know, networking isn't
about you. It is, but it isn't. It's
really about connecting
with
those that you are excited to work with.
It is also about connecting with those
people who are posting the jobs.
Sometimes in a job application,
especially if it's coming from LinkedIn,
you will see a profile of the person who
posted the job. That's an easy ad that
you apply to the job, then you search
for that person's profile, you follow
them, you go to the more section, it
will drop down and you can see message
or you'll connect with them and you'll
automatically be able to message them
directly through LinkedIn.
You let them know, hi, I just applied to
this role. super excited. This is what I
can bring to the table. This is for
recruiters, talent acquisition, HR
professionals that may be those leading
these searches for these positions,
right? So, you're trying to build a
rapport with these folks.
It doesn't also have to be a followup to
an application.
If you have target companies that you
are looking at that you really want to
work for,
research the company on LinkedIn, find
them, click on the company and then look
for those that are working there. How
many of you know how to do that?
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Good. If you do not,
it's okay.
message me and we'll meet up and I'll
show you how to do it virtually. Okay.
>> This this was
>> Yeah.
>> This was what we like you showed us last
week, right? I think.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah.
>> Yep. Yep. Yep. I went through that last
week. Yeah. So,
example of some genuine check-ins. Um I
mentioned the one uh you know,
congratulations for a 2-year
anniversary.
I also there's also uh one um hi Rodrigo
I remembered you mentioned you were
moving into product management I came
across this article about transitioning
careers and thought of you
hi Alex you mentioned your team was
expanding how's that going exciting
genuine
one two sentences
nothing wild,
nothing extensive.
So, it's really about
making yourself visible and you can use
different things, a life update anchor,
right? Like, hey, I saw you moved. Hey,
I saw you've been freelancing with
TechJoy Academy, and it made me think of
your journey. How have things been
going? What sort of projects are you
working on? Just little check-ins.
Some examples of weak transactional
openers. Hi, do you have 15 minutes for
a call this week?
Hi, we haven't talked in a while. Can
you refer me to your company?
Very transactional. Um, one of the other
students, uh, Key, you might know Key,
she has actually been doing something
rather genius and she has been reaching
out to her network, so folks that she
does not know at Target companies that
she wants to work at. And she's been
reaching out to folks to see if they
would be interested in scheduling time
for a virtual coffee chat.
A few folks have responded and have done
the coffee chats, which has been
fantastic and surprising. Others have
not. But then she's had other folks who
haven't been able to meet up for the
coffee chat, but had her send questions
to them that they could possibly answer
that might be helpful for an aspiring
developer, which has been amazing. and
the this this system has been working
for her and I think something that I'm
going to talk to Dr. Emily about
implementing into the curriculum because
it is super smart and genius. Um now
I
this session so session B as I mentioned
we will be showing up talking about
showing up authentically
on LinkedIn.
Best practices for commenting. Let's run
through that a bit. Something that would
be weak. Congrats. You know how people
post, I just got promoted or I got a job
and you know, you can make a comment and
it'll automatically input something with
like a balloon or uh one of those sound
blowing things that you have at parties.
Yes, of course it's easy. And I'm also
uh guilty of doing that. Congratulations
sort of thing. But congrats on the
promotion. What's been the most exciting
change in your role so far? That makes
it a little bit more meaningful and it
also strikes up a conversation,
right? It it is a framework.
Yeah. Exactly, Michelle. Yeah.
And there is a framework. So you
acknowledge like congrats, thanks,
interesting. Add a perspective, a story
or a question. Keep it short, two to
three sentences.
And the key point, your comments reflect
your voice and expertise more than your
profile sometimes does. And this is why
it's important to actually engage with
LinkedIn
to create your own posts. Maybe you
listen to a podcast
um uh about development,
full stack, low code, what have you, and
you thought that it was particularly
inspiring, share it on LinkedIn.
This it starts the engagement, right?
So, the three you rules of genuine
networking message, keep it short.
Does it matter if it's in your industry?
I mean, it matters if you're targeting
getting a job.
Yeah, sure. I mean, and this is really
what we're talking about. We're talking
about networking
to identify a job whether that is
full-time freelance
uh consulting.
I mean you could just have people that
you admire
um
and you're sort of just following maybe
it's a hobby but for
gaining employment this is really the
focus.
So again, keeping it short, you aim for
two to three sentences max. Long
messages feel a little overwhelming,
especially if you haven't spoken in a
while or never met.
Think a quick check-in, not a full
catchup essay.
Here's an example,
right? Uh, and I think I ran through
this one before. Hi Sam, congrats on
your new role at Joy of Coding. How's
the transition been for you so far?
Make it specific.
Ref reference something real. A past
conversation, their career move, a
recent post,
a shared experience.
Specificity
shows that you're paying attention, not
mass messaging, and not copy and
pasting.
We're looking for impactful, unique.
So, this this is a part of
the process of getting a job.
Networking, networking, networking. Hey,
Dorian.
Now adding
>> hello.
So
now number three because I'm running
through three rules of a genuine network
message in the framework. So number
three add curiosity curiosity. Ask a
light question. End with a gentle
open-ended question that invites them to
reply. Avoid questions that feel like a
big ask or require lots of effort.
Short and sweet.
Yeah.
Hi. An example.
Hi Allison. I remembered you mentioned
launching a project last time we spoke.
How's it been doing?
So
again, the quick formula that you can
follow,
greeting in specific detail plus brief
acknowledgement or gratitude plus light
question.
Now, putting it all together, here are a
few examples.
Hi, Chris. I just saw it's your 2-year
anniversary at Joy of Coding. Congrats.
What's been the biggest change in your
role since you started?
Hey, Alex, thanks again for recommending
that podcast months ago. I've been
hooked.
Have you come across any new ones you've
been enjoying?
>> Hey, Jordan, I noticed your team just
launched a new product. Congratulations.
What part of the process do you enjoy
the most?
simple,
straightforward.
Now,
here is what I would like to do where we
uh I propose that we do a guided
practice.
Um,
now
pretend
that I
show a sample or I show a post
and the main subject of the post is why
junior developers struggle in
interviews.
I'm sure all of you might have
experience with this, right? As you
continue to practice for the technical
interview,
write a comment that adds to the
conversation.
Okay, so again, take a moment,
pretend that someone that you follow,
could be me, posted an article
about why junior developers struggle in
interviews.
Write a comment that adds to the
conversation.
What would your comment be?
Could be drawing from experience.
It could be drawing from experience as a
a junior developer.
Or
maybe you were a junior developer
5 years ago
and now you're a hiring manager hiring
junior developers.
So now you have two perspectives
and all of you are going to have that
experience.
At some point you are going to be hiring
for your own teams.
So, let's take a couple of minutes.
Funny, Elissa.
Let's take a take a couple moments
and
think about that
and write down
write a write down what your comment
would be. That adds to the conversation.
And you can we'll either talk about it
or you can do what Dorian did and copy
and paste
in the comments.
How's everyone doing? Finished.
Okay. Dorian shared. And I like I
totally relate from when I was
recruiting
uh or first got started in recruiting.
So Dorian uh wrote purely performance
anxiety that and I haven't really done
the necessary prep work in university
and was thrust into the job field not
knowing I needed to do all of that even
to be considered.
Okay.
Who else would like to share their uh
comment that they they would uh post if
they read that article?
Who's gonna share? Otherwise, I'm going
to pick someone.
>> I shared mine in the chat, too. That's
literally what I would So, I would
either say performance anxiety or it
would be the meme. It's depends on how
I'm feeling.
>> Oh, okay. Okay. That was your Okay,
gotcha.
>> Okay.
Michelle gets panic and tongue panicked
and tonguetied.
And Rodrigo and I talked about that
today in our one-on-one. Taking a a deep
breath and standing in your power
because you know all of this.
Just have to calmly
pull it out and express what you know.
Turtle, what about you? Do you have
something to share?
>> I just need to spend more time hanging
on, hanging out on there. Like that's
there's times when I go to Facebook and
don't accomplish anything. I need to
redirect that time spending time
scrolling through LinkedIn.
>> Okay. Okay. Rodrigo, do you have a
comment uh any uh idea of a comment that
you would share?
>> Yeah. So, I was actually uh writing and
sometimes it takes me a long time to get
the right words, but I was saying hi and
then saying, you know, the name of
whoever uh posted. So, hi John.
>> Yeah,
>> that's a very interesting question and
topic. I believe one of the things that
play a big part in how a candidate does
in an interview is related to how they
present themselves.
>> Uh do they show up like and that's the
part where I stopped but I would I
wanted to say like do they
>> show confidence um or do they seem
reserved because that's one of the
things that we talked
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 100%.
We talked about coming up with a script
about discussing who we are. And this is
a little bit off topic of the the
objective of what we're immediately
speaking about, but if you to Michelle's
point,
if you
get tongue-tied and nervous during
interviews,
for the most part, a re an initial
interview with a recruiter is typically
the first step. Then if you pass the
recruiter, the recruiter will share your
resume and any you know your GitHub if
you have a portfolio yada yada send that
uh share that with the hiring lead. The
hiring lead will then say, "Yeah, I want
to meet Mac, Alyssa, and Rodrigo.
Maybe, but let's let's see how they do.
And if I don't move forward with any of
them, we'll pull in Dorian."
Okay.
Then all of a sudden, you're in front of
the recruiter, and the recruiter will
say, "Mack, it's great to meet you.
Thank you so much for taking the time to
connect with me. Tell me a little bit
about yourself.
That's when it has to be
like butter rolling off your tongue. No
ums, no likes,
no you knows, no so.
It's pure
confidence. You're talking about
yourself.
And if you get tongue tied doing that, I
used to
um see
I used to
but for interviews and I still do it
when I am interviewing for a company. I
craft my script. Who am I? It's a nice
little exercise.
Who are you?
You're more than your code. I
>> you better be.
>> I don't know if if this is part, you
know, pertinent to the conversation, but
cuz I, you know, like just what Glenn
said in the comments was basically what
I how I described myself, right? Cuz he
says it's lack of confidence in my
skills, underelling. And I said that to
you today. And but bringing up my
background as a teacher,
>> uh I always felt that while I was
teaching,
>> I sort of put up a show or a performance
in a sense that
>> Yes. Outside
>> I'm doing that right now.
>> Exactly.
where outside I can just like okay now I
can relax and just it's fine for me to
you know not worry too much or I I don't
know but while I was you know teaching
in in
>> let's say then I you almost like put up
put on this uh performance I guess.
Yeah.
>> Yeah. No, you do. It's all an act. It's
all in a performance. That's what I'm
doing right now.
But it
also it I know that I'm helping people.
So that is also what drives me. But
getting back to what what Rodrigo has
been saying and and and what Glenn said
and really what all of you are saying is
that you come up with your script so
that it rolls off your tongue and you
can be on a Zoom call
with an interviewer
and you can have that script up on your
screen
or memorize it. Just keep talking it
through. I write scripts for pretty much
everything that I do,
for recruiting, for work.
I will if I know that I have an
important meeting with a managing
director, a chief talent officer, a
chief finance officer, because those
people, male or female, are very scary
chief finance officers. And I'm not a
numbers person. So I, you know, that's
where I get my um Oh, Nanda would be
very upset that I'm not remembering this
term. Um,
a lot of I get a lot of self-doubt like
I can't talk like I am not good enough
to talk about numbers. What do I know?
How can I contri possibly contribute to
this conversation with this crazy chief
talent officer?
>> Is that chief finance officer?
>> Is that what they talk about numbers?
Yeah.
>> Oh yeah. It's all about numbers, baby.
All about scope and can we afford it?
Percentages
of scope that people are build against.
So, I guess the theirect response would
be, "Do I look like a calculator?"
>> Yeah, but you can't you can't you can
maybe think that, but you can't say it
to a chief finance officer. Oh, no.
Especially when you're going to them to
let them know that the software engineer
that you want to hire and that everyone
wants to hire is coming in at 20K above
the band.
Then you have to then I then I have to
get my t tap dance shoes on and start
performing
and
then I have to write a rationale. You
have to talk through the rationale.
So it's
it's a balance, right? But the point is
is that I will come up with a script for
that meeting and I will practice that
script because I'm a salesperson. I
might be a recruiter but I'm also a
salesperson. That's what I do. I'm also
um if I am prepare helping
a candidate prepare for an interview, I
will write a script for myself
because I want everything to be I want
to make sure that I'm advocating for
this person
beyond what I can imagine.
especially if I'm trying to convince
uh a hiring lead that we need to hire
this software developer above 20K
above the band
and then looking at his team and
considering internal equity that's
another conversation for another day
like this is what recruiters go through
I know recruiters are bad bad right I I
know. I know. I get it.
>> So trying to get away trying to get
>> trying to get rid of his team and take
him.
>> I'm sorry. What's that?
>> So you're trying to get rid of his team
and just take him.
>> No. Uh the antithesis.
>> When you are hiring a position,
There are a lot of questions that you
come with. It's more than
looking at a job description. You meet
with a hiring lead. When you meet with
that hiring lead who is adding to his
team,
you ask a variety of questions.
You ask a question about pedigree.
Are you looking for people from certain
colleges, universities, organizations,
etc.
Are you looking for people from a
specific company?
You're also going to HR and you're
saying to payroll, your HR director,
your HR generalist, whoever handles
this information, salary information.
But if you're a good recruiter
and a smart recruiter, you will find out
the salaries, the base salary of
everyone on that team, especially those
who have the same title as the p the
candidate that you're looking for. Why
is that important? Well, most of the
time, hopping around to different
companies allows you to increase your
salary.
And I will tell you from experience
transparently
that I have made that mistake.
I have chased the money
and it's bit me in the ass.
Being at a company, growing and evolving
in a company, there's nothing wrong with
that.
So
you go to HR as a recruiter and you find
out the base salaries of everyone in
that group. You pay close attention to
other software engineers who won are in
the group who have already been there.
Say the base salary of three of them are
150k.
But this new software developer coming
in that's incredible that everyone wants
to hire with the same years of
experience, similar pedigree as the
other software engineers.
That person wants 170K.
Is that fair?
Not fair.
And then I'm I'm going to as a recruiter
I'm going to look at the diversity
of that team.
I am.
So, it's important
that new hires are coming in at a band
where they're not going to hit a glass
ceiling. What does that mean? It means
in a year when you do performance
reviews is that person that you just
hired even if they chill it
bring in new business
clients love them. Everyone loves this
person. Are they going to be able to get
a raise? Probably not
because they're way above the band. And
now we're playing catch-up with the
other employees.
So these are things in the back of your
mind to understand and think about.
Um okay getting back to is there any
value in lowballing your value to get
your foot in the door? Um
sure but it's all in how you articulate
that turtle.
Yes. I come with X amount of years of
experience and in my past roles I have
made more but this role is a role where
I know that I can be impactful on the
team.
I know that I can grow and I can be a
success and I can bring everyone else
with me. So
I don't want to price myself out of
consideration.
Therefore, I'm very happy to be
considered within the salary band that's
been posted.
That's how you articulate it.
And there will be another Q&A session
down the road about negotiating salary
because that is a technique for sure.
And I'm just one of those I'm a very I'm
an honest recruiter. I don't think I
have met a recruiter like me because I'm
not hold the secrets to the chest and
no, let's just let's get down and dirty.
Let's throw it all up on the table and
then let's talk it through and figure
out how we're going to make it work.
And everybody's trying to get a job and
fill a job. So
that's how you do it. Honest
conversation.
Um,
when and how to repost content.
How many people have reposted content
that you've seen on LinkedIn?
Dorian has
a couple other peeps. Cool. Yeah, 100%.
I'm g lower my hand.
Um,
don't just hit repost,
right? Add some context. Dorian, do you
have a real question or you just Is your
hand still?
>> I I did I did want to speak just just a
small bit.
Yeah,
>> I I I admit to being one of the guilty
people who uh do not use LinkedIn nearly
as much as I probably should. And I see
a lot of my
>> on you,
>> whether it be my alumni or uh other
people within my field, etc. trying to
use LinkedIn to to connect with other
people. I know that my number of
connections, for example, is pitifully
low for somebody within my position
looking for a job, etc., something like
that. So, I was hoping if I could find
some resources on how exactly to make
those connections cuz uh from what I've
been seeing, a lot of my alumni, at
least from university, have been like
learning about how to just make posts on
LinkedIn to try and get engagement. Even
if it's something that I wouldn't really
care about, they'd be making posts every
week just to ensure that, you know,
something's on the board, make it seem
like they're active. I don't really do
too much. So, where can I, you know,
bring these posts from? Like, what do I
talk about? Things like that. I suppose
that doesn't need to be answered now,
but like where can I find that
information?
>> Yeah. Yeah. No, that's and we you and I
are meeting tomorrow, so we can talk
about that tomorrow as well. But for the
group, um I mean I start personally I've
been starting with podcasts.
I have been listening to uh some
developer podcasts. I got to tell you,
you guys have absolutely no idea what
they're talking about because it's like
learning a It's like learning a
language, right? I I love listening to
French.
Um I think it's just so beautiful. I do
not understand
it. I listen to French radio, Italian
radio, Spanish radio. I have no idea
what they're saying, but
I love
hearing other languages. And I suppose
it's because I was living in New York
City for over 40 years. And now I'm in
upstate New York. And I have to be
honest, I miss culture. I'm starving for
culture. I am just starving to walk down
the street and hear a million different
languages that I don't understand but
somehow that's so comforting. Um but
I've been listening to and thank you
Raul the data camp podcast. I'm on it.
It's been tough. I am like what in the
heck are they talking about? I get
really excited for the participants
of the podcast because, you know,
they're so excited about talking about
this code and they're like, they get
really into it and I love that. But I am
trying to se segue into being a tech
recruiter. I haven't recruited for tech
in many many years and the tech space
changes so quickly. Um, so that is um
what I do. I have been listening to
different podcasts based on whatever
uh periodicals thanks turtle that they
might be talking about in these
podcasts. I'll research them and then
post them on LinkedIn.
that's,
you know, things like that, articles,
projects that you're working on that
have been produced and you're proud of.
Maybe a friend of yours or a a previous
uh colleague at a job or in university
post uh an article.
um you know and it can be an example.
This article on remote first companies
resonated with me because
loved seeing this project from TechJoy
students. It reminds me why
collaboration matters.
Once a week or every other week, focus
on quality. Doesn't have to be every
day,
but it is a technique. And what did we
learn the first week of this
um
of these Q&A sessions about focusing
about LinkedIn and why it's so
important? Visibility.
Visibility is critical because again
remember what is the first thing
recruiters do when they receive your
application or maybe you were referred
to them who's been listening who's been
paying attention
come on Glenn I think you were in the
the first first session
>> your LinkedIn Now
what's that turtle?
>> They go to your LinkedIn.
>> Okay. They go to LinkedIn.
They look at your profile. They even do
that before they look at your resume.
And profiles matter.
Definitely nicely organized. You've got
a nice banner, professional photo.
Your title doesn't just have software
developer.
What else? Because again, it's not just
about being a software developer.
Yep. We need you to have beautiful code.
We need you to know what you're doing.
That's a hard skill. Like hard skill.
But we need to know that you're
collaborative.
We need to know that you
enjoy perhaps mentorship like what else
about you highlighting your hard and
soft skills?
What about that contact information?
What's there?
Nothing.
email address
con a way to actually contact you
because again by I can't say this enough
the most annoying thing for a recruiter
and I have held grudges
like if you are an amazing candidate and
you keep reaching out to me on LinkedIn
but you don't accept my my invite so
that I can't message do and I don't have
access to your email.
So, guess what, bro?
I will delete your message because it's
useless to me.
I'm here to fill a job and I will bust
my butt and advocate for you and get you
the most money I possibly can for this
role.
But
fill out your contact information.
So annoying.
Summary. Get something in there. I don't
want to see bullet points in your
summary. No.
Take the time to write something
meaningful. And now now with AI,
there is no excuse.
I
don't even get me started about how kids
have it so easy now.
I I won't even get on my I'm a Gen X
kid.
I won't I won't do it.
But it's important to make sure that you
have a beautifully pract crafted
LinkedIn profile because it really does
make a difference.
And don't be afraid to post the work
that you've done
first
asking people like if it's any work from
TechJoy, making sure you go to Alyssa,
making sure you go to Dr. Emily, making
sure that they know that the client
approves posting
the work that you've completed and work
that you've done for them because that's
the beauty of this program. you're
actually able to work on real work for
real clients. That's why this uh coding
coding academy really does
is above a lot of the others. So, take
advantage of that. Make sure you're
highlighting what you've done
and share it. Share it far and wide if
you're able to share an article that
inspires you. Just, you know, try to
unless you're already working and you
have a job and you want to take a snap
of your dog passed out on the floor with
their tummy up while you're working.
Like, okay, that's fair. And I will
always take animal like obscene
pornographic animal photos. I'm so down
for all of that. Just kidding. Tummy
tummy photos,
but
stick to professional
information sharing.
And this is again a way
to spark conversation, right? So,
authenticity
versus performative posting.
So, here's a group brainstorm.
What makes posts feel fake?
So, bragging, generic, inspirational
quotes.
Have you guys seen posts that you're
kind of like, "Oh my god, that's so
stupid."
Yeah. Okay. Oh, well, I saw you nodding
your head. You're like, "Oh, yeah." All
right, Dorian, too. Okay. All right.
Yeah. Allison's sneaking her hand. Oh,
there were two hands. She at one point
had two hands up.
>> Well, I have a question or something
like
>> Oh, okay.
>> Um, if I see a post
>> and it's like a wall of text, I usually
just don't even look at it. Like if I
have to hit the the button to see more,
I don't want to do that.
>> Yeah. Yeah. And you know what? There may
be a point where it that longer posts it
means something.
But when you are reaching out to someone
at one of your target companies or you
are posting an article or a link to a
podcast that was impactful, things of
that nature, keep it short, keep it
sweet. I loved this, you know. Uh yeah,
Raul. Yeah. video posts.
Yes,
you can do video posts if you want to.
If you are comfortable in filming that
sort of content and if you're
comfortable in front of a camera, I am
not. The camera does not like me.
Every angle is not a good one.
So yeah, if that's your niche, if that's
your thing and you feel comfortable and
you feel like it's warranted, sure. But
tips for authenticity.
Use your own voice. Don't copy copy
corporate jargon.
Highlight others work, not just your
own.
Glenn could be partnering with Raul and
Rodrigo
on a project. They're all busting their
humps, working really hard.
Alyssa reviews it, submits it to Dr.
Emily. Dr. Emily is floored. The client
is floored.
The project is produced.
You guys are like the kings of the day.
Post it.
If
you know, Alyssa and Dr. Emily know and
you've gone to them first again to make
sure that you can post it where client
is cleared.
That's that's good stuff. That's a
worthwhile post. Or maybe you just want
to give maybe Glenn had a very long and
arduous night with Raul and Rodrigo
working on a project and he just wants
to shout him out. Hey, shouting out my
partners on this project that we're
doing. More to come. It's a secret
project. It's going to be super cool.
You know, stand by for more. But
shouting out these guys right here. And
then he can add their profiles.
You can do that, too.
But authenticity builds trust. So this
week, your homework is to post one
thoughtful comment and write one post.
Pay attention to how people engage. And
this is just for you. I'm not going to
be like, "Send me a screenshot. I want
to see and I want to grade." No, you are
your own.
You answer to yourselves
and this is for you.
So why not why not engage?
Why not do it?
Um, Chelsea, you said one thoughtful
uh post and one
meaningful comment.
>> Uh, so yeah, I'm going to I'm
going to copy and paste this
into the chat.
[Music]
There you go.
Post one thoughtful comment and write
one post. Pay attention to how people
engage.
Any questions, thoughts,
concerns,
anything you feel I can do better?
Dorian, your little paw is up. Is that a
mistake or do you have more to say?
>> Oh, I just I just forgot it was up. My
bad.
>> Okay.
>> Okay.
>> But there's that. I mean, we'll talk a
lot more later, so I'm I'm kind of
reserving my questions for then, so you
know.
>> Oh, I can't wait.
>> Yeah. But other than that, I appreciate
these sessions. Very helpful.
>> Of course. Of course. And folks, if any
of you have missed the previous
sessions,
I do believe that they will help you a
great deal with uh you know,
restructuring and editing your LinkedIn
uh profiles. These are all recorded, so
check them out. And that's the beauty.
You could just rewind it, listen, and if
you have any questions or you want to
connect with me oneon- one, always here.
Always here. I met with Rodrigo today.
We had a great conversation
and I will have another conversation
with him for as many hours and as many
times as he would like to meet. I work
for all of you.
Okay.
This is who I work for. I am typ Yes,
Dorian.
>> Oh, sorry. I just wanted to ask if I did
want to set up another meeting with you
like outside of the one we have
tomorrow, uh, how would I go about doing
that? Do you have like a public schedule
that I would be able to like request a
meeting for or I do not message
directly?
>> That works. Okay. Yeah, that work. That
works.
>> Yeah. Yeah, for sure. No problem.
>> Yeah. And we're all cool. The more the
marrier. Um, typically I am very
accessible and my uh tech joy days are
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Thursday
and Friday then I'm a little bit MIA,
but send me a message on Discord and I
will respond as soon as I see it.
Good.
questions, concerns, thoughts.
>> Everyone's good.
>> This was helpful. This is my first
meeting with you and I thought uh he
gave some great info. So, I appreciate
it.
>> Okay. And uh Dorian uh logged on um a
bit later and that's fine. So, you can
you know based on what your schedule is.
However, I am a little bit of a stickler
about having your video on. And the
reason why I do that is because this is
basic. If you are an employee at a
company where there is you are a remote
employee,
you have your camera on
unless of course you are sick. if you
are in the middle of driving like of
course like you know nobody's a slave
driver but yeah you want to be able to
um you want to be able to do that
uh because we you know want to see your
beautiful
>> Oh I have I have my camera it's oh for
heat I was not wearing your shirt so
that's why
>> it is super hot here
>> he said for heat reasons It is for heat
reasons. I guarantee you hot or you just
hot.
>> It is too hot over here. I'm going to
call it the weather. Right. We're going
to We're going to say the weather.
>> All good. All good.
>> It's lovely to see you, sir. Thank you.
I uh I did not in mean to call you out.
>> No, I understand.
>> No, I understand. I understand. It's a
valid concern.
>> Yes.
>> Yeah. No, no, I'm not. It's not
concerned. Um, but yeah, you know what,
Michelle? If you interviewed with
someone who never turned their camera
camera on, don't work for that company.
That's just gross and disrespectful
because you are a candidate taking the
time.
No, absolutely not. Um, I'll leave you
with this. I had a candidate call me
after an interview very upset.
And this is keeping in mind that I
specialized for about 20 years in
creative advertising
um recruitment, which should really say
it all. Um but the person that he
interviewed with was smoking a joint
while he interviewed the candidate.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. So,
>> what was the job?
>> Well, he was inter interviewing for an
associate creative director position
>> and there was a the person interviewing
this associate creative director was a
creative director and he was going to be
working for this associate creative
director
and
>> was smoking a joint in the interview.
>> Yeah, good stuff. Good stuff. That's
advertising, folks.
>> And a lot of weirdness. Yes, it is.
>> Um, all right. Anyone? Anyone else?
Everyone, it has been such a pleasure. I
thank all of the newer folks that I've
seen. I think um Michelle, I maybe saw
you once or twice. Maybe Mac. Um, I'm
just still figuring out names and faces
and all of that. So, Raul, welcome. And
Dorian, yes.
Oh, I'm excited that I met um new folks.
So, thank you for your time. Have a
beautiful evening and rul
>> friends. Have a beautiful one.
