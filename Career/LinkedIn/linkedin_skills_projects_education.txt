Good morning. How are you, Key?
Good morning. I'm doing all right. How
are you
hanging in? I have to work on on some of
my skills though on the pure to pure
mentorship part. I will tell you that um
after an hour and a half of working with
somebody and them not understanding the
concept and walking through go going
through it not giving them the answer
but working a different way through it.
Um, in the end I kind of had some
decisions to make if you know what I'm
saying. And I'm like, okay. Anyway, um,
I have to work on my no, you need to
work this out yourself part. So, I'm
still working on that. Okay.
>> Yeah. Yeah. That's a that's a skill that
I think Katrina has mastered of getting
someone to be able to think it on their
own and push them in the right direction
to to find the answers.
It's truly a craft
>> and and you're just sitting there going,
"Okay, um all right. We've done this and
we're getting this." And do you see?
No, I want to know where the other half
of it went. Well, we commented that part
out. Yeah, but I wanted to come back.
Well, then uncomment it. Yeah, it went
like that last night
>> for over an hour and I shouldn't have
done it. So, you know, I'm still working
on my skills. Okay.
>> Yeah.
>> I mean, the peer mentorship is half of
us helping people who are stuck and half
of them teaching us how to, you know,
get people to be in a position to be
able to solve the problems that they're
facing on their own. So,
It's limits and boundaries. Okay, I'm
just gonna say hi. How are you? Okay.
Sorry. Didn't mean to derail
>> Mindy. No, you weren't derailing at all.
You should finish.
>> No, I I think I'm done. Otherwise, I'm
gonna get myself in trouble. Okay.
>> No, no worries at all. How is everyone
today?
>> Doing all right. Welcome. Welcome.
>> Yeah. Cool. Turtle. Turtle. What is your
real name?
>> Oops.
Hey, Melissa.
>> Melissa's back. Yay.
Hello.
>> Mouse and keyboard on different side of
the room from the microphone currently.
>> Oh, no worries. No worried. at no
worries at all. Um I will get started um
and we are going to continue
uh to discuss LinkedIn
and I am actually also a little teaser
working with Dr. Emily
on um something that I'll start
integrating into these Q&As. So um more
to come there.
I uh but today we are going to continue
with our um with our LinkedIn
uh journey. Uh this week the theme is
showcasing your skills, projects and
education. And I know that we have been
talking about skills a little uh
already, but now we're going to be
digging a little bit deeper in the
meaning of hard and soft skills. why
it's important that you uh showcase
those a little bit. Um yes. And um how
to basically the goal is to leave with a
clarity
um on what skills to list uh how to
present the projects that you have been
doing with um uh the academy and how to
leverage uh your boot camp experience
confidently.
Uh so
uh if I have for all of you right now,
right? And this is uh something for you
to think about. If someone looked at
your LinkedIn profile right now, what
would they think your superpower is?
So you know you don't need 10 years of
experience to have a strong LinkedIn
right. So clarity and confidence always
win.
So think about that a little bit um and
and think about it throughout this Q&A
session. So again, we are looking for
the answer to
if someone looked at your LinkedIn
profile right now,
what would they think your superpower
is?
So have that in the back of your mind.
So understanding the skills section.
Now the objective here is to help you
identify what skills matter for
recruiters and hiring managers.
And you know, we've learned throughout
the past 3 weeks that having skills
listed on your LinkedIn profile is
critical because LinkedIn is the first
step that recruiters use to identify you
and to poke around and see what you're
about.
Okay.
So
the skills section will start with the
hard and the soft skills. And this is
what we've been talking about quite a
bit over the past couple of weeks. So
the difference between hard skills which
are technical and soft skills which are
more collaborative and problem solving.
So you can frame it like this.
Hard skills get you the interview.
Soft skills help you pass it and keep
the job.
Both are essential essential.
And you know, remember tech is a team
sport, right? You can't do a job within
the tech industry on your own. It's
always a group collaborative effort.
So let's talk about this a little bit
deep deeper.
Hard skills versus soft skills. And
again keeping in mind that initial
question.
Someone looked at your LinkedIn right
now. What would they think your
superpower is?
Okay.
Hard skills. What you can do.
These are technical teachable abilities
usually learned through training courses
or hands-on experience. They're easy to
measure and often show up in job
description and LinkedIn skill lists.
examples for all of you.
JavaScript,
React,
NodeJS, Git, GitHub, REST, APIs,
debugging using tools like VS Code,
Figma, and Postman,
testdriven development,
SQL, NoSQL. Think of hard skills as the
tools in your toolbox. They show what
you can do
and everyone following
any. Okay, I see nodding heads. Awesome.
Soft skills.
Soft skills. How you work with others.
oftentimes I have found
these are the most critical
because you can code, you can be a
master
at production, you can know a bunch of
people and you know uh have worked in
some of these industries.
But if you're not a problem solver,
if you don't have empathy,
if you are not adept at giving and
receiving feedback,
that's going to prevent you from
elevating,
from evolving into senior,
into a manager,
into a director.
into any seuite representative.
So that's soft skills. That's your
reputation.
It's how you use your tools and how well
you work with others while doing it and
using those tools. Problem solving,
communication,
time management, adaptability,
teamwork, and collaboration.
empathy,
giving and receiving feedback
because again you are in the place that
you are right now but in a few years
you are going to be managing teams.
You're going to be interviewing people.
You are going to be hiring people.
So these hard and soft skills really do
matter.
I hope
love the glam today.
You're bringing it bringing it full full
face today. I love it. You look
gorgeous.
>> Gorgeous.
>> Okay, there you go.
>> Thank you for dressing up for me. hope.
So,
a few recruiter secrets here, right? And
and it's something that we've talked
about.
ATS and LinkedIn recruiter heavily rely
on the skills section
of your LinkedIn profile.
skills in your profile
should match those in each job
description you see. And for the most
part, all of you are focused within low
code or full stack
positions so they can blend into each
other.
Make sure you have all of those skills.
Focus on relevant skills for today's job
market, not just what you've learned.
And then add 30 to 50 skills. LinkedIn
allows up to 50.
though and and I've seen uh other
uh profiles
within
both tech creative
um
go to market positions.
Uh so all of these
roles and all of these profiles you can
see that they the the those in the
profile have really added quite a bit of
skills. So when there's lean skills I
see uh or a LinkedIn profile that is not
robust. It's for the most part it's
someone who a hasn't had a lot of
experience, which is fine.
Or
folks that are in a full-time job, maybe
they've been in a job for many years, or
they popped around and have uh not had
um not had needed their LinkedIn profile
for the most part. Um, but definitely
something that should be kept up to
date.
Um, so
who has questions? Any questions at the
moment?
>> When you say to list skills, are you
talking like strictly the like hard
skills that you were talking about or
also list trying to list like the soft
skills?
>> Both. because as we've learned both are
important. Um and you know as I came
into the conversation you and Mindy were
talking about the peer coaching right
and and and key are you picking up some
of those peer mentorship duties.
>> Yeah I mean I'm a I'm a peer mentor. I'm
not heading them. Katrina is still
running the peer mentors but
>> sure sure but you are a peer mentor.
Yeah, there you go. Pretty sure that if
you look on LinkedIn and in where the
the section where you put TechJoy
Academy or Joy of Coding, however you
listed it, you should make sure that you
look up mentorship or mentor. That's a
skill that a soft skill that should be
listed. I'm pretty sure LinkedIn does uh
have that option. But certainly
something that you should know and that
is critical because as you continue to
accept new positions, as you continue to
uh grow in uh this work, you will be
tasked with mentoring juniors.
oftentimes
uh when new employees start at an
organization
um and some organizations
uh have a practice of giving someone um
a buddy or a mentor when they first
start in a position. Typically it is
someone that is a frost capability but
who they will be partnering with. So if
it is let's say a developer it might be
someone in strategy or QA or client
services depending on the organization
perhaps a designer or a product or UI or
UX partner depending of course on the
organization.
One of you might be tasked with
partnering with that individual on their
first day and for a few weeks after,
helping them with the cadence and flow
of onboarding and orientation,
familiarizing them with the time sheet,
uh, weekly time sheet submissions.
um any kind of um important documents
that they need to fill out and hand into
talent management or HR or people
operations.
That is a common thing that is done
right assigning people a buddy so that
they have someone that they can contact
for questions. Um, and then oftent times
it is someone on your team who is maybe
being hired. Maybe you are hope you've
been hired as a senior full stack
developer and key has just been hired as
a uh, you know software developer in the
organization but on your team. So you
have been tasked with bringing key under
your wing to help familiarize her with
the client work with various weekly or
monthly meetings. Um so you know there
are ways that you are sort of tasked
with being um a mentor. So definitely
something that is important.
Um
any other questions?
No questions. All right.
So
turning,
you know, how what I would like to
um
I'd like to shift into framing projects
like a pro. So I know part of the
academy curriculum in the academy is
having you take on real projects and
that really is critical because it shows
that you've worked on real work on a
real team that you you know you weren't
just sort of attending classes and
listening to lectures that you've been
hands-on and and it's an opportunity to
show that you've done the work and an
opportunity for you to shine. time. So
using I would encourage you to use a
project framework. So what it is
plus what tools you used
plus what you built
and then ultimately what impact or
result it had. Let me put this little
formula in the chat here so that you
have it as a reference.
Okay,
so there's the formula,
what it is, what tools you used,
what you built,
and then what impact or result it had.
And now this is uh probably more when
you're talking about uh in the section
where you can note where you've worked
and maybe you want to put a little
description of a project that you worked
on there.
So here is let me come up with an
example.
built a full stack budgeting app using
React, Noble.js,
and uh MongoDB that allowed users to
track expenses. designed UI for
intuitive UX deployed with uh Netlifi
reduced friction uh yes reduced friction
for new users by 25% in testing.
So it's giving you the what it was right
the what tools you used to
complete this project
what you built and the impact and using
what I've been hearing
Dr. Emily talk about in some of the
videos in the go high level when she's
talking about the job hunt videos and in
that content she really does talk about
metrics and quantifying
what you've done.
So adding if you can uh a percentage or
a factual result, that's always a good
thing if you have that information.
All right, I would like to open up the
questions for all of you because what
I'd like you to do is name one project
you're proud of.
What tools did you use?
So, think about that for a few moments.
And I'm going to allow you to
think about this and then write all that
down.
And what we'll do is reframe
a couple of your answers or a couple of
your responses using the framework that
I just provided.
And I will copy and paste the
example in the chat
so you have the full
full example for you to look
I have a question.
>> Yes.
>> Um so in that example the built full
stack budgeting app using React the you
know reduce friction for new users by
25%
in testing.
Sometimes a lot of that feels like fluff
like like it feels like some of that
might be like hard to quantify.
Um is that question much
>> or is that asked to sort of be question
justified? Okay.
>> As as a recruiter I do not question it
and I don't dig into that. That is
something that hiring managers may dig a
little bit deeper in if they're looking
if something like this is noted on your
LinkedIn or your resume and they maybe
looked at it or you know they want to
ask you about oh talk to me about this
project.
>> Okay.
>> Thank you. I would note it only if you
can talk about it and and you can
successfully
uh quantify it. If you can't, then don't
list it. But it is nice to be able to
have some sort of of
quantified result.
>> Got it. Okay.
along the same lines.
>> Um, we just did this React Jam project
in four days where we built as a team we
built a tra uh a task manager. Okay. Um
technically it's up and running where
people can view it, but we certainly
couldn't say that it's um
reduced friction for new users by 25%.
Um not sure how to bring that up. Um if
anybody's got any ideas that would be
wonderful because it's not just
>> yeah this was just an example
um
it's not if you again if you can't
quantify it if you
>> then don't list it
>> only if only state what you did
what tools you used.
>> Okay.
>> Exactly what you know what it is, what
tools you used, what what what you built
essentially
>> what the impact or result was that it
had if there was an impact or a result.
You can also note this is a project that
we worked on. It was you know for a
group.
I would try to list projects that you
are most proud of and you can absolutely
speak so fluidly.
I and I didn't mean to put you on the
spot with the example that you put in
there, but I'm, you know, it's
>> it's more about the um it's kind of a a
weird little
niche kind of an app, I think, more than
anything else. It was
>> simply more of a proof of concept, I
think, more than anything else, but not
sure.
>> Thank you, Mindy.
Yes, Key.
>> Um, I was gonna kind of give my two
cents to Mindy. Uh, you know, because
our I was gonna talk about the app that
my group made for the challenge week.
And my idea for like as the result or
impact was like um was able to provide a
100% complete and usable product by a
strict deadline
or by the strict deadline. Um because
like we didn't necessarily improve
anybody because it didn't exist
beforehand. But we did produce something
that is 100% usable because we followed
the you know slick um tool or the slick
uh idea um idea of making something that
was simple, lovable and complete. So
>> that will definitely help the sl focus
on the slick side of it. That would be
good. Okay. Thank you.
>> Thank you, Key. And Leo just uh put
um a good one in the chat.
And if the rest of you completed
one, please drop what you've completed
in the chat so that we can all review.
Thank you, Leo.
anyone else still working.
Yes, I have something. Um we're you I'm
working on lowd do low code um project
and it's inclusive it's called inclusive
and you know we're we're creating a
course um to educate and involve
employers and employees in what um
inclusive is what it's what it's meant
to be and so um so far I've used aa word
press um comfy for images, uh, CSS,
HTML, and JavaScript.
And then when it says what impact and
results it had, you know, I'm not really
sure until it's actually put out in the
marketplace and and actually companies
use it. And then those those companies
are rated by um there's an organization
like a human rights um organization and
they they rate companies as how
inclusive they are. So I think that
would be what impact they had but you
know it's a lot of um content creation
and um a lot of research a lot of
research for me. So,
[Music]
>> yeah. I mean, until it is, you know,
launched into the market, you can always
note that
um it's a work in progress, but you can
note the work that you've done. So, the
result is still pending.
Okay,
Turtle.
Okay.
And then he built a habit tracker app
using JavaScript with React that allowed
users to track time spent on habits led
the team to deploy fully functional
apply
deadline.
Nice.
Excellent. Yeah. Okay. I think that's
great.
Uh, turtle.
I would
maybe
Oops. Where' it go?
I would maybe not say micro Microsoft is
horrible as distinctive namings,
but
keep things sort of
professional
and sort of topline what you did again,
what it is, what tools you used, which
you you did. You said you made a plugin
for Revit.
Um, you talked about the tools.
You talked about what you built,
but I'm looking for the result.
Let's move down to Melissa.
Ah, I see. Uh, beautiful turtle. So, if
you maybe play around with that
paragraph a bit
and add what it did, this is solid.
And Melissa currently building
uh
test for personal wellness patterns.
Okay.
Yeah,
great
Anna. That's great.
I mean some of these I would say you
know play with them a little bit in some
a of the AI platforms whether it's chat
GBT or Claude give it a little bit more
finesse but these absolutely follow the
formula.
Excellent.
So what I would like to move on to
unless there are more questions on this
or if you want to keep working on this.
Are there any other questions about this
particular
portion?
And now these this is also an exercise
that is not only for LinkedIn
but this is also for your resume as well
right because oftent times even in a
functionally a functional formatted
resume
you're talking about what you've done
you talked about what you can offer and
showing examples
solid examples of of what you've done
and highlighting
your boot camp or education
and what you've done in that boot camp
and education to which has prepped you
for stepping into a role. There are ways
to frame that as as well because you
know your boot camps, your certification
programs, yourmies,
they're they're not training, but
they're proof of commitment and skill
development. So what you are doing isn't
for nothing. This is valid.
What you're doing is you are developing
your skills.
Yes, you are in training, but this is
your proof of commitment and that skill
development and that is important.
You know, boot camp is more than
coursework.
It's full-on projectbased learning
and and
to
develop that and to
write that in a way that is convincing
on your resume or your LinkedIn.
You have to highlight these capstone
projects as well as your collaboration
skills because recruiters, hiring
managers, anyone that you're
interviewing with, they are going to
want to know that you have those skills.
But again, going back to the hard and
the soft skills, they're equally
important, if not more, the soft skills,
right?
So when you're listing your boot camp,
when you're listing what you've done at
Joy of Coding,
name the boot camp.
List the technologies that you learned.
List your notable projects
and any additional C certifications if
applicable.
Okay. So, they just, you know, they just
might look a little bit different.
And you know what? I think it might be
good for me to share my screen
for this.
Okay. Can you all see my screen?
Yes. Great.
So, let's look at the LinkedIn version
that I I created and they they look very
similar, but the formatting is a little
bit different.
So
you would add this under your education
section. Okay. So you've got TechJoy
Academy
full stack web development certificate
program
when you started
to know
here are the technologies that you
learned
and then listing notable projects.
Clear,
simple,
does not have to be lengthy. does not
have to be insanely detailed.
Task flow pro built a full stack task
manager using React Noble.js and MongoDB
integrated real-time updates with
socket.io.
Boom. Low code CRM tool collaborated on
a client-f facing CRM built with Glide
apps to support small business
operations.
clean, clear, to the point. Now,
make sure that when you are prepping for
your technical interview,
for any meeting that you're having
within an interview loop, for any
position that you are interviewing for,
anything you know in notable projects,
make sure you can speak to them in
detail.
That's when the detail is important.
That's when we want to know
what you've done. And it wouldn't
necessarily be the recruiter that would
ask the questions unless
the developer lead or the developer who
is making this hire into their group.
They may ask the recruiter specific
questions or information to glean from
talent in the initial recruiter screen.
That might be a way of separating
the those who will be moving on to the
next interview loop or those who will
maybe not write for this position for
maybe for another one down the road or
maybe you know what
hope has a position open in her group
maybe key is better suited for that
position.
So oftentimes I if you're not right for
the role that you're interviewing with,
there may be either a role in another
team that maybe isn't posted or a
position that is being curated right now
in another group that hasn't been
approved by finance to move forward with
sourcing.
It could be a million and one different
things going on. You just don't know it.
So, showing up, being on top of your
game, being organized, being able to
talk and articulate
all details about the projects that are
listed on LinkedIn
and or your resume. That's going to be
critical. And then, of course, we have,
you know, any certifications that you
may have done. And yes, certifications
that you've done through LinkedIn
learning, it counts a lot.
Certificate in web stack or full stack
web development techy academy. It's not
redundant. If you re received a
certificate,
list it.
If it's relevant,
list it.
Now,
we're going to take a look at the
resumeé version and how it's listed.
It's similar.
Take a look.
Ah, this is a little bit different in
terms of formatting,
but we've got the information. Okay.
And of course, we add this under the
education or technical training section
of your resume.
Techjoy Academy certificate in full
stack web development.
June 2025
completed immersive 16week program
focused on modern web development
practices and collaborative project
work.
talking about the technologies that you
learned that you are fluent in
do not put something that you kind of
know.
Oh, I looked at it before.
What do you know?
What will you pass on a technical
interview? What are you confident at?
And also what inspires you, what makes
you excited?
Key projects listed here. And then we're
listing the certifications here,
questions,
thoughts, opinions. This is a safe
environment. We're all friends here.
Let's talk about it. What do you think?
>> Yes. Key.
>> Yeah. So, I was going to ask for putting
it on the resume,
is it better or it maybe of both is
good, but um to have the like
descriptions of like what you've
completed as far as the education for,
you know, Chroy Academy versus like um
just having the internship or the the
junior dev listed as work experience.
Um, I think it can be both to be honest.
Um,
because
the way that Dr. Emily
has curated this program,
it's not only
an academy where you learn to code.
It is unique in that toward your like
your last real sort of big project is
you being an intern. It's you working on
real work, holding a real position as an
intern,
participating in real projects.
So I think that that warrants a
a special
curation. on both your resume and your
LinkedIn profile. And I think that you
can mention it in both places.
You can list it where your education is.
But if you are a junior developer in or
and or intern
can note that that the the reason why
Dr. Emily created the course in the way
that it is is so that you are able to
apply to positions straight out the
gate.
You don't have to step into a an intern
or a junior position at a company. I
mean, you can if that's what you choose
to do and if you feel that that's the
right opportunity for you, go for it.
But the idea that she has is that you're
stepping into
a position as a software engineer or a
data analyst or a business analyst like
you're actually stepping into that role
hitting the ground running. It's not a
junior role.
And again, you know, titles vary at
different organizations.
So it it does you know depend on where
you're applying and sometimes if it's
you know a more let's say for example a
more purposedriven
organization
say it's the ASPCA
maybe they don't have you know a
a ton of money to hire a full staff but
they can pay someone a robust salary. to
be a full stack developer and do some VA
work and some other low code stuff. You
know, when you're at a smaller
organization or an organization that
doesn't have a ton of funding, oftent
times you are, you know, you're wearing
a lot of hats, right? Which is also a
huge bonus at times. So, it really
depends.
But again, as you can see, it's a little
bit different with the structuring
and how it's listed. LinkedIn, the you
know, the the insight is to perhaps
break things down a little bit.
You're because again, what have we been
learning about your LinkedIn profile?
What have we been learning? It's you as
a human being. It's the human approach
to what you can offer
link your resume.
This is more more straight and to the
point, more professional. Here it is.
Thoughts. I'm going to stop sharing
thoughts. Insight.
and a Dane.
Okay,
I uh will be reviewing this again at
6:00 p.m. this evening Eastern time.
I would either way if all of you are not
going to uh participate at six, totally
cool. Um but session B will really be
active. So you will be revising these
sections in real time.
So we'll get you know peer and coach
feedback in real time while you update
your LinkedIn profile.
Uh we will probably be doing some
breakout rooms
exciting
um and live edits where you'll share
your screen to see how you've updated
your LinkedIn profile
project section education and boot camp.
Um,
and a couple of things that I would love
for you all to think about as as you
exit
uh this evening or this this
um afternoon session.
I'd love for you as a homework and
especially if you're not going to be
participating at 6 PM to update the
skills and education sections in your
LinkedIn and maybe even your your resume
since we've talked about it.
Add at least one project with a strong
description.
And bonus,
share one project on LinkedIn this week
with a short caption.
and and tag Techjoy.
So, not within your profile,
but
sharing something maybe that you've
completed or you've learned,
right?
Because that's a part of it and that's
what we are going to start getting
deeper into. And this is the type of
conversation that I'm having with Dr.
Emily.
She is so proud of everyone in this
program
and we are constantly
strategizing and thinking about
how to
encourage you to
reach a little bit more in your
six figure job hunt because all of you,
every single one of you has the
potential to get that and you will. You
will land the six-f figureure job 100%.
I know it. But it's going to take even
more
actionable
duties,
networking,
lots of networking.
And what does that mean? It's not just
about applying to the job. Okay, done. I
applied. Let me write it on my little
spreadsheet. Done. Nope. Doesn't end
there. Not by a long shot. You apply,
but then you go to LinkedIn and you
start researching
the company.
What have they done? What have they put
in out into the market that has changed
lives? if they have or what has gotten
publicity in the trades,
what have they been acknowledged for?
What are they most famous for? What what
work do you love? What are the other
people that work at the agency posting?
Look at their posts and then con you
don't have to necessarily connect with
those people, but follow them
and then you email them. you or not
necessarily email, but you message them
on LinkedIn. How do I get to do that?
You got to connect with them. Follow and
then connect.
Send them a message. I recently applied
to this senior product engineer
position. I'm so inspired by the work
that you do. One project that
I was most impressed with was this.
I am so enthusiastic with the thought of
joining your team and I know this is how
I could contribute.
That's the kind of f that's the push
that's the energy that we're looking for
and that is what is going to land you
visibility. Visibility is so important
because I tell you right now there are
oftent times I receive messages
I receive I see people who have have
applied where I'm like hm interesting
not right for this role but let me put
them in one of my LinkedIn projects
because this is what I think this is
where I think they'd be right
and I might share
a LinkedIn profile with a hiring ing
manager.
Hey, I know that you're not
uh I know that you're not uh hiring for
a BA. Check out this person.
Um Kai, yeah. Can we have a section on
LinkedIn communication hooks? Almost
like sales scripts. Sure, why not?
Why not?
It's about
standing out in the sea of applicants.
There's a lot there are a lot of
applicants right now and that's it. It
it you know what it's not impossible and
I believe what Dr. Emily says. I believe
what Lindsay Mustain says. I believe
them because they're in it and they're
successful and Dr. Emily has built this
incredible program
and you see that students have been
successful too. Yes, it's a tough tough
job market.
It's I would like to say I I am I am now
referring to it as it's a unique market
and we just have to find more creative
ways to stand out. That's all.
And we will we are and and look at the
support that we have. Look at all these
faces.
and and we've got, you know, people like
Katrina,
right? So much support.
We will um
Oh, sorry. Um,
yeah. So, I want to go I would love for
all of you to think about
start thinking about how on a weekly
basis you can start interacting with
LinkedIn a little bit
and keeping it focused within the work
that you're doing. I do see one or two
people posting on LinkedIn and it's good
that there is a LinkedIn presence, but
sometimes it's a little
Off topic,
keep it.
I
My beloved HR director that I worked
with at Habas
always told me, "Keep it simple.
Keep it simple.
Got two minutes.
What
what can I what questions can I answer?
How did you all like
this session? Was it helpful?
Yeah,
>> it's been a great session. It really
has. Thank you.
>> Awesome.
I want to make sure that
there are no there's no confusion.
Yes,
>> Identifying the differences between
LinkedIn and the resume I think are
really
uh important and challenging thing to
think through if you're not sure sort of
even what should be presented in either
of those situations.
Um, in regards to how to stand out, I
mean, is this something that we need
like some sort of,
I don't know, additional thing to bring
to the table other than our technical
skills
that we need to present somehow as part
of the conversation.
>> You know, again, it it's your skills.
There's the umbrella under skills,
right? And then you've got the two hard
skills, soft skills. You need to be able
to curate both your LinkedIn and your
resume
to mirror each other somewhat
very close mirror. But again, the
LinkedIn is the human, the who you are.
And you have to be able to
articulate
how you hold both areas
because again and you hi come on. You've
you've been a
professional executor. You've been a
leader. You've been client-f facing.
You've hired people. You've mentored
people.
You've likely
worked with individuals that were
incredibly
talented from a hard skills perspective,
but maybe they absolutely could not get
in front of a room and speak to clients.
The gravitas was missing
there. There is a need to have both. And
if you feel
as individuals like you know what
my soft skills are a little lacking and
you know what it's it's where you know I
have a problem presenting I get really
nervous in front of people
maybe think about
doing smit improv at a
you know a comedy
uh uh place
right we used to and juniors when I
worked in creative advertising at Oglev
and Mather and I was hiring junior
designers, copywriters, art directors,
we would attend as recruiters, we would
attend their uh client presentations
and we would evaluate who needed
some
some work in presenting and being in
front of their peers. ers or clients and
we would send them to the Upright
Citizens Brigade in New York City. They
would do improv classes.
So,
practicing in front of the mirror,
practicing in front of each other.
Hard skills, yes, you have to have them.
But you know what?
Soft skills are so important and being
able to communicate that you can do both
is critical.
