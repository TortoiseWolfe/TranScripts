https://youtu.be/8UoPlSP7AVo

Hello.
Hey, I'm doing good. How are you?
>> I'm pretty good. Thanks for asking.
>> Glad to hear.
>> We'll just Yeah, we'll just wait a
couple of minutes until some other folks
join.
>> Sounds good.
Hey there, Kai.
Just going to give it one more minute
until some other uh folks
join and then I'll start.
Good morning.
Okay, I am going to begin so that we are
on track with time. How are both of you
doing today?
Doing pretty good. I managed to show up.
I've been late or not attended the last
couple of weeks and I felt so bad for
myself. I was like, why did I miss this?
>> All good. All good. How's it going with
you, Kai?
>> Doing well. I got to see the uh the moon
last night.
>> It was gorgeous. I got to see it too. It
was massive where I am. So,
>> Leo, welcome, sir. How are you doing
today?
>> Doing good. Doing good.
>> Excellent. Excellent. Thanks for
joining. All right, all of you fabulous
people. Uh we've got some cool things
going on for what is week 12 in our
LinkedIn journey. believe it or not. Um,
we are going to talk about optimizing.
We got another one.
Hold on just a second. Me let Lisa in.
Where'd she go? She's gone. There you
are. Hey, Lisa. How's it going?
I'll take that as good. Um, all right.
So week 12 LinkedIn lesson plan we are
going to be talking about optimizing
for recruiter searches. So, still moving
and staying and evolving in that area
for making your profile visible, but
making sure that your LinkedIn profile
is structured with the key words that
recruiters use to run their searches.
Because what we have learned over the
past 12 weeks is that recruiters use
LinkedIn as a search tool. I am actually
doing that right now with my freelance
job. So it's
really does lie uh this lesson lies uh
within the broader 12 week LinkedIn
strategy. Right? So week one to two, we
built a professional and complete
profile. Um you learned in weeks 3 to
four uh to tell your story through your
summary, your skills, your projects.
Week week week five we focused on
customizing your URL and settings to
make your profile easier to find.
Weeks six through seven, we grew your
network and learned how to maintain
authentic connections.
Week eight, we crafted outweek messages
that built trust and open doors. And
then week 10, engaging publicly,
posting, commenting, using hashtags.
the following week, week 11, you learned
to use job alerts and filtered
strategically.
So now you know how to show up and who
to connect with. This week is about how
recruiters find you. Okay, so really
this is
search engine optimization, right?
Um, so we've
got some key talking points to run
through and really talk about why this
matters.
Recruiters search LinkedIn the same way
that you search Google, using keywords.
So the right keywords
increase your chances of appearing in
LinkedIn recruiter searches.
The wrong
or missing keywords
make your profile virtually invisible.
So even if you're highly qualified,
recruiters are not going to see your
profile if the key words are not located
in your profile. So fun fact,
according to LinkedIn, 90% of recruiters
use keyword filters to find candidates.
So candidates with keyword optimized
profiles receive two to three times more
views from recruiters.
So,
the goal is that you want your profile
to match recruiter search terms,
rank high in those search results, but
also attract more recruiter messages and
interview opportunities.
questions,
thoughts,
comments.
>> I have a question.
>> Yeah.
>> So, as like a recruiter, like you say
you use LinkedIn as like a search
engine. Is that like I mean as somebody
looking for a job, like we put like the
job title in. Is that similar to how
like the recruiters do it? put like the
the job title of what they're trying to
look to fill and then sort by people
instead of like job listings.
>> Yes. Yes. And I am going to um as we get
a little bit further into this course
lesson, I'm going to show you a search
that I've been running since this
morning. So, I landed a freelance job
and it's very different from the type of
recruiting that I've done in the past.
Um, and they have me running searches on
one role that I am looking for, I
believe, in your area. Hope actually
North Carolina. That's where you are,
correct? Yeah. So, um, it is in in your
>> You're in South Carolina. Okay. This is
in North Carolina actually in Raleigh.
Um, but I will show you a little bit of
how I've been sourcing for that. Yes,
Lisa.
>> First, good morning. And
>> um, good to see you. Um,
>> yes, you as well.
>> You can see me.
>> I cannot, but that's okay.
>> Um, something's going on with my Zoom.
Um the
one of I wanted to ask you if this was a
good tactic. Um
I get um
I don't I'm not trying to be offensive
so I'm going to go ahead and say it. So
sometimes I get things for just folks
that are from the Middle East or India
>> and it says you're hiring
and I started responding to them.
>> Okay. You're brave.
>> A lot of the time I find them to be
fraudulent.
>> Is that is that
>> reachouts? But
>> you say it's fraudulent.
>> Um some Yeah. I have just like you know
some of the call center odd text calls
that that you've received sometimes you
have to sift through them. So oftent
times I have had folks my husband's a
designer he um gets a lot of those
messages as well. Sometimes they're
legit, sometimes they're not. So I mean
and that obviously can be with any um
industry but I have found it to be very
prevalent since co
>> Okay. I I just you're the expert so I'm
going to rely on um
>> Well, what have you found since you've
been corresponding with them?
Um, I'm actually getting um more
requests for IT positions that are in my
field such as QA because I I listened
and I applied some of the um a lot of
the suggestions you provided and it's
actually
turn I I fixed um my profile in
LinkedIn. I fixed the
>> Indeed.
>> Fantastic.
>> Indeed. you know, I just went to each
one of and I'm starting getting more in
line with what I used to do, which is
quality assurance or software testing
>> and I'm trying more of programming
positions. So, I'm truly looking at
those positions um and applying to them.
>> The the second interview, I'm starting
like I finally got that interview and I
got that second interview, but I didn't
get the third and I did follow up and I
showed you my my thank you letter, I
think.
>> And I've been told it's an excellent
thank you letter, but I got ghosted. So,
I don't um I'm kind of I'm back on the
drawing board. So,
>> yeah. Yeah.
>> But,
>> it has happened to me uh several more
more than I can count over the the past
year or so. So, don't don't be
discouraged. It's not you. It's it's the
you know whatever process that the
recruiter is going through oftentimes
they may find talent that they think is
perfect for the role and perhaps
uh hiring managers
have said we like this particular
candidate and oftentimes recruiters will
will zero in on that and no one likes to
let people know bad news, right? No one
likes to deliver that news. As a
recruiter, I get on the phone and I will
deliver that news as as in person as I
possibly can. So, on the phone or
through Teams, Zoom, Slack, whatever
video platform that I'm utilizing at the
time. Um, but I always close the loop.
Unfortunately, a lot of other recruiters
do not, whether it's just their style or
they're working with a very heavy
workload and do not have the time.
I'm not trying to make excuses for them,
but just to let you know that it's not
it's not you.
>> Well, thank you. I appreciate it. I um
you have been
um great at responding. So I I just want
to thank you also because your your
advice has been
some successful barriers that have been
broken. So thank you.
>> Excellent. Okay. Yeah. You know, I think
that
approach every email that you receive
all of you with curiosity and
research, a mind of a researcher.
oftent times
you uh
non US companies will come to folks in
the US and now I am seeing and hearing
of a lot of people even in my own
industry as a recruiter
getting emails from f folks from other
countries who are looking for assistance
they have heard about how a lot of
people are out of work right now and
looking for work. So
that is good news as far as I'm
concerned that a net is being casted
from non US uh countries to US residents
and if their companies are set up to
work with foreign nationals of their uh
native uh country of origin.
I think that's amazing. Get all of us
all of us working and and you know what
the time difference might work and um it
it might work for some of you and then
you can get that on the job experience
to sort of wait this period out and keep
applying and keep interviewing, right?
But just, you know, proceed with a
curious and a researcher's mind. That's
that's what I would say. Research the
company. Find the individuals on
LinkedIn. Does do they look legit? I
think that we've covered what LinkedIn
profiles should look like and be
structured enough for you to be able to
sus out if it is a fake profile or not.
And it happens. Fake profiles do occur.
And I experienced it a couple of years
ago myself at um IPG health a uh
healthcare agency a healthcare
advertising agency. I don't know if I
told all of you or how many of you
heard, but we had situations, a few of
them, where there were fake recruiter
profiles set up by AI generated photos
um in the profile pick that stated this
person or people worked at IPG Health
within human resources.
essentially
found individuals,
hired them, sent them onboarding
materials,
their 1099 or I-9, their W4, had them
fill everything out so they got all of
their personal information, and then had
them send a copy of their credit card
information so that they could send
equipment to them.
We companies by the way if you join a
company and they are sending you
equipment
the expectation is never for you to pay
out of pocket for that equipment that is
equipment if you are employed by that
company that they are obligated to send
you. So just make sure that you
understand that. And I think that you
know there are moments in our lives when
we are very eager
to
identify employment.
Just be scrutinizing, be cautious
because this ended up having to go to
the Department of Homeland Security.
uh five people were scammed. The the
company is a huge uh publicly traded
organization, so they certainly had the
financial backing to do this
investigating, but the five individuals
still had their identity compromised.
They still had to go through all of
these things. And if you ever had your
identity compromised, I have, it's not
fun and it's years and years of fixing.
So, thank you actually for bringing this
up, Lisa, because it
you do have to scrutinize nowadays,
especially with AI and all this
technology.
Yeah, I did have one of those companies
that you mentioned actually um
approached me last year. I thought I had
a job uh
with a company called TSG. They the
company didn't even know they had
duplicated their uh company name and
everything.
>> Yeah. Their logo. They can do
everything. Yeah. Yeah.
>> And they go so far as posting fake job
descriptions under that company logo. So
these things do happen.
>> Yeah. I even had an interview. Yeah.
>> Yeah. Yeah. So let's get back to
understanding LinkedIn
um CEO. So again, the core concept is
search engine optimization. And on
LinkedIn, this means using the exact
keywords that recruiters type when
searching for talent. Okay.
key fields that impact the LinkedIn uh
search engine optimization. We have run
through this before because we've set up
our LinkedIn profile. So, our headline,
right, weighted heavily heavily by
LinkedIn's algorithm. That's why
I recommend
not just putting your name and
underneath your name for the headline
full stack developer. Great. You'll come
up in full stack developer searches and
it's great that you have that in your
headline. But
putting even more, you know,
two or three more
uh keywords in your headline is optimal
for that uh maximum visibility.
Your about section, you know, needs to
be scanned for res re res relevant
skills and job titles and recruiters
will do that. the experience section,
job titles, and then remember those
skills
that we added in there, those are
searchable.
And then of course, project descriptions
are indexed.
The skills section,
so whenever you put skills in your
experience section, it's also listed
more at the bottom where it lists all
your skills together. Top 50 skills are
searchable and contribute to recruiter
search ranking.
Your recommendations, believe it or not,
as well. Keywords in recommendations
also count.
Engagement.
Posts and comments that include relevant
terms improve visibility.
Pretty cool. And we talked about that a
week or so ago about posts and your
comments and how that increases not just
your visibility with the person that you
may be sharing their post and then or
what you're saying or commenting in that
post. It all is cumulative. every single
thing that we've been talking about over
the past 12 weeks.
Questions, thoughts, concerns.
Good.
All right. Thumbs up from key. All
right. So,
how do recruiters search?
So, putting this up on my top screen, so
it's going to look like I'm not looking
at you guys. Um, so
recruiters enter
boolean searches. Remember we talked
about that last week. Okay, some of you
were here uh may have not been here. So
I am going to just plug in the chat.
Hopefully everyone can see it. Key, you
got my back. For some reason someone
can't see it. if you would mind
reposting that would be great. So, you
know, recruiters enter boolean searches
and here is a quick example.
Like this is what we're looking for. And
why is there why are there quotes there?
Because we want to
we want the result to reveal those
specific keywords, right? So they filter
oftent times by location, industry,
experience level, and keywords. So
profiles are ranked by keyword relevance
and engagement.
Is this the one that I put in there? All
right. Here's another one that I came up
with.
And this is a recruiter search string
for a coding role.
that I
I've done I've done in the past myself.
So these are the types of searches we
would the type of boolean searches that
we would would plug into the LinkedIn
browser
just to get an ice just so that you all
get an idea of how these boolean
searches are structured
and then why they matter. You can see
that
So
recruiters don't scroll LinkedIn
aimlessly. Um I have
in many instances and I do now
just go to LinkedIn, plug in a bunch of
like some keywords or a boolean search
and then I'll like just filter through
all the pages. It's
uh laborious for sure, but I do like
looking for that needle in the hay stack
and having a little bit more control of
my searches.
Um but
um
we also use an extension of LinkedIn
called LinkedIn Recruiter and that is a
paid search tool that allows recruiters
to find candidates based on keywords and
filters that um
that LinkedIn allows you to plug in. So
they they come up with all of these
different filters and they have these
dropdowns and I'll show you what I'm I'm
talking about in a real search that I'm
doing right now in just a moment. But so
for example
um
the
last Boolean search that I just put in
the chat, right?
This search tells LinkedIn,
"Find me developers
who know React, NodeJS or JavaScript
and have experience with APIs,
uh, postgre SQL or AWS.
That's what this is saying." Now,
LinkedIn matches the words in recruiter
searches to words in all of your
profiles.
So, if you use different terms or omit
keywords, you won't appear in their
search results.
That is called mirroring.
And this is why it matters. You must use
the same words recruiters use, not just
words you prefer.
Well, how do I know what recruit words
recruiter use uses? They use these
professional terms just like you do
same exact way.
Okay. So,
a side byside sort of example, right?
So, full stack developer
the headline in the headline somewhere
it should read full stack developer.
in the about section. Say the recruiter
is searching for a software engineer.
The about section should say something
like, "As a software engineer, I build
and deploy web applications using React,
NodeJS, and PostgreSQL."
I'm sure I'm saying that incorrectly, so
don't laugh at me. Oh, Key, I see you
smiling. I see you laughing. Are you
laug?
>> I'm not laughing. I just love how every
time you're like, "Don't laugh at me.
You just make me smile every time."
>> Well, listen you guys, if I'm not saying
something correctly, please correct me.
Please, please, please. Um and also so
for recruiter search keywords for React
or NodeJS or JavaScript in the skills
section you need to have React NodeJS
and JavaScript it's got to be there must
be there
keyword searches for API post GRES SQL
or AWS in the experience section
somewhere where you worked.
There must be developed restful APIs
using NodeJS
and postgre SQL deployed to AWS for
scalability. Like it's got to be it's
got to be there.
Okay.
Questions, thoughts, concerns.
Okay. So before we walk through
any other
uh anything else, let me share my screen
because I want to show you what I'm
actively working on right now. And this
is an example
of LinkedIn recruiter.
Okay, here. Can everyone see my screen?
Yep. Okay. LinkedIn recruiter. So, I am
looking for
an outside sales rep in Raleigh, North
Carolina. And this is for a company
called Renuity Home. They are a
uh one of the largest um I would say
home improvement networks in the
country. Okay. and they're the fourth
largest provider in the US with multiple
industry leading brands under their
umbrella. So they've got uh something
called home or and then they do
something called closet America which
focuses on closet design and garage
lining and design.
And I am looking for someone who is an
outside salesperson working on both um
it would be nice if they had some sort
of construction experience even better
if they had some sort of home decor or
interior design experience perhaps. Um,
so I went to
I went to LinkedIn recruiter
and
let me see. I created
my talent pool and I'm hoping that I can
pull this up and I can. Let's see.
Sorry, my computer is a little bit slow.
So if you can see here
there are custom filters
and hopefully ah so this is what I
plugged in
with my custom filters right outside
sales representative field
representative contract sales
representative outside sales account
executive outside sales development ment
manager in home sales. This was the area
that I was working and I like to cast a
wide net. So now that I've gone through
uh a bunch of these and
uh moved these people over into my
project where I will email these folks
and continue to evaluate. Maybe I'll
even drill down a little bit more and
put in some skills and assessments.
But this is kind of like the brain, the
reasoning behind
what I'm I'm talking to you about to
give you a little bit of that idea. So I
will stop sharing.
All right. No. Um
headline.
All right. So,
here is a couple of optimis optimization
practices that I think we've kind of run
through um before when we were setting
all of this up in our LinkedIn. Right.
So
before we optimized some of our
headlines, maybe we had something like
passionate developer, problem solver,
creative thinker. Okay,
our about section. I enjoy learning new
technology and building cool projects. I
love collaborating with others and
continuously improving my skills.
Okay.
Skills, teamwork, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Okay. Now,
after the optimization,
after we maybe mirrored our recruiter
search,
and now, just so you know, I interviewed
or I did one-on-one sessions, let me
see. Yeah, with all of you. So all of
you know what that experience was like.
This
before optimization example was actually
taken not from one of your resumes but
another student
that I edited.
And so this is my what I came up with.
Headline
full stack developer JavaScript react
NodeJS API integration
the about section after I edit it. I am
a full stack developer specializing in
React and NodeJS with experience
building REST APIs integrating postgreql
databases and deploying applications on
AWS. I'm passionate about clean code,
scalable systems, and collaboration in
agile environments,
better
that
that about statement
will be picked up in keyword searches by
recruiters who are searching, right?
skills
React, NodeJS,
JavaScript,
Post, GRE, SQL, API development, and
AWS.
The headline matches recruiter search
titles.
The about section repeats and
contextualizes
keywords.
And the about section supports the same
language,
right?
So, how to mirror recruitment teams?
So,
analyze target job postings.
Okay? So when you're looking and you
find a job that you want to apply to,
highlight repeating terms.
React, agile, API integration, AWS.
Note job title variations
because there are right software
engineer,
full stack developer,
front-end engineer.
Embed those key words across your
profile
and your resume by the way.
So, the headline, use your target title
and top three skills.
In your about section, use phrases that
recruiters type.
We've learned what those are.
Tie each project or task to one or more
target keywords.
I'll say that one again.
Tie each project or task to one or more
target keywords.
Add every hard skill listed in multiple
job postings.
So again,
three to five postings of your dream
role.
If you've got time today or this week or
this weekend and you're doing you're
you're focused on your job hunt,
take a look at some of those job
postings.
Print them out if you can or if you
can't pull them all up and size them so
that you can actually review all of them
and highlight the keywords that you're
seeing.
Make sure those are on your LinkedIn
profile and your resume.
Match variations.
use multiple forms of the same concept.
API and REST API,
ReactJS and React,
AWS and Amazon Web Services,
SQL and
Post, Gre SQL.
Avoid keyword stuffing,
right? So, yes, you want to get those
keywords in there, but don't cram a list
of terms without context.
Always use keywords and real sentences
that show how you apply the skill.
So, here's an example of a weak This is
a weak example.
and like cramming.
Ah, postgresQL.
Is that how you say it? Okay, cool.
Learned something today.
So, a week one,
React, NodeJS,
PostgresQL,
AWS, API, Agile.
Okay. And
but here is strong way of using that
developed full stack applications using
React and Node.js
managed
postgresql
databases and deployed to AWS using CI
and CD pipelines
context.
And then
applying keywords strategically.
Identify what those keywords are.
So again, review five,
three to five job postings that you
want. Write down recurring words,
phrases,
and then use LinkedIn's skills section
to confirm trending keywords.
And then integrate keywords naturally.
So
add these keywords into your headline.
weave in skills contextually into your
about section. I specialize in building
full stack applications using React,
NodeJS, and PostgresQSQL,
experienced in agile workflows and API
development.
Just break it down and then shape it.
your experience section.
Add technical achievements with keywords
tied to outcomes.
Built restful APIs with NodeJS that
reduce data load times by 40%.
The skill section add all relevant hard
skills
encourage
um you know rearranging
top 10 most important skills first.
That's what I encourage you to do.
Recruiters may search for different
titles. So, optimize your synonyms,
right?
encourage
uh I encourage you to
use several not several a few different
ways of referring to
what you are who you are full stack
developer software engineer web
developer React developer front-end
engineer UI developer what resonates
with you and maybe use a few within
LinkedIn
LinkedIn favors
active profiles. That's another thing.
So I, you know, I encourage you to again
post at least once a week using relevant
keywords.
I'm excited to finish my React app
today.
Comment on post using industry language.
And then follow companies and hashtags
that reflect target roles.
So
SEO turns your profile into a recruiter
magnet
and
keywords make you discoverable, visible.
Visibility leads to interviews which
leads to offers.
So again and
just like your GitHub,
just like your portfolio, just like your
resume,
your LinkedIn profile is constantly
evolving. You should be constantly
looking at ways to optimize it and
optimize the visibility. So update your
headline, about skills with I don't
know, 10 to 15 relevant keywords. Maybe
review what you you you have so far.
Engage with three posts this week that
align with your target tech field.
And then say five job alerts that match
your optimized keywords. We did all of
that last week.
And
next week we will be talking about how
to build credibility through projects,
portfolios, and endorsements. So we'll
take it a little bit further. But you
know, you've built your LinkedIn
foundation. Now it's time to make it
work for you. So, optimize for recruiter
searches or optimizing for recruiter
searches can be the difference between
being invisible and landing a six-figure
opportunity. Recruiters don't just look
for talent, they search for the right
words. And make sure your profile speaks
their language.
So, I've left 10 minutes to talk um and
run through any concerns or questions
that you might have. I believe key,
you've got some you've got something
coming up at one, correct? Okay. So,
we've got to be punctual,
guys. So,
what you got for me? Yes. Key.
>> Yeah. I have a question. And so when you
were showing the like recruiter tool,
>> you had like the matches at the top that
had like I don't know like the the
>> I don't know like I keep thinking of
like inbox filters essentially, but like
it had like people who were open to work
versus and one of the categories was
interested in a company and I was
curious how much of an impact that has
on like your recruiter search and then
how do you make like how would I make my
profile say that it's interested in a
company.
>> Um I believe
I believe that you it's um oh when you
follow a company.
>> Okay.
>> So if you follow a company
your interest is going to pop up in
recruiter searches.
>> Okay.
>> Yeah. I didn't know that. based on
what based on the individuals that
uh this uh job title filter has
produced.
Yeah, that's what that was.
Anyone else?
No.
10 more minutes, gang.
Is there anything that I went through
today or in previous weeks that you
would like to review or discuss?
>> I have a question. So,
>> yeah. Um, so we're taking this course,
this boot camp, and so mine is a career
change. So, how would
we move
um you mentioned um in the experience as
far as
um keywords like the JavaScript and the
um
no G which we've done on our projects.
Do you just put that in the projects or
>> you list them in projects? You list it
in your headline, you list it in skills.
Yes. So if you are
uh
noting experience that you've had at a
certain company or even a boot camp
>> and you want to list what you did at
that company or in that boot camp, you
can discuss a project must be I
recommend that is a project that is
produced produced and that you can show
an example of should they ask.
Um, and then list what you did and
include
the
technology that you use to execute it.
Uh, whether it's, you know, code or
programming languages, database,
whatever it was.
and
discuss your role
and what you accomplished.
>> Okay.
>> So, these little projects that we're
doing um
the React Jam and and the little
projects, we can add those to
>> Oh, sure.
>> Yeah. resume and LinkedIn profile for
sure. It's all searchable and it shows
that you've worked on real work on real
clients. And this is
how and why Dr. Emily designed this
program this way because she identified
that
a lot of times graduating from these
boot camps, you're going into junior
roles. Well, why not provide a junior
role here
>> at TechJoy where you are working on real
projects, real work with real clients.
Highlight that. That's critical. Shows
that you are qualified to step into a
role.
I thought was really cool was there um
there's some software development in
test which is actually a programming
position but it's actually just
designing the testing part of it and
automating.
>> Okay.
>> Um I thought that was kind of cool and
it kind of really does fit into I'm
taking my leap of faith again and saying
let me try this see if I'm getting
better responses and and it seems to be
help.
We'll work it.
>> Fantastic.
Um, all right. I'm getting some sort of
alert that I have been signed out
because my account has been signed in
from another device. So,
let me bid all of you farewell. If any
of you have any questions about today's
session, feel free to join me. um at
6:00 p.m. I will likely not be doing
these sessions at 12:00 noon anymore.
So, I think I'm going to end up doing
them in the evening. So, 6:00 p.m.
Tuesday, likely 6:00 p.m. Thursday. I'm
just waiting to hear from Dr. Emily on a
confirmation with that. But, um again,
if you've got any questions, feel free
to join me this evening or ping me on
Discord and I will circle back to you.
Have a wonderful, wonderful day all of
you.
>> Bye.
