Career Strategy w/ Chelsea - LinkedIn Summary Workshop (Evening Session with Profile Reviews)
https://youtu.be/Gtjaa4FaBmE

Oops.
Hello there.
>> Hello.
>> Hi. Hi, King. Hi, Chelsea.
>> How are you both?
>> Real good. Real good. Thank you.
>> I'm doing all right. I've got a
headache, so I'm sitting in a dark room
listening to to this.
I don't have my camera on for that.
>> I'm so sorry to hear.
>> Oh, I'm so sorry to hear.
>> It's It's been a day of it. So,
>> a day of migraines, huh?
>> Yeah.
>> Sorry to hear that. Well, we will make
this interesting. Um, depending on who
shows up this evening,
um, I'll give it just a couple more
minutes and we'll see who ends up ends
up coming in.
>> Awesome.
>> Mhm. Good.
Chelsea, where are you located?
>> I am located in upstate New York at the
moment.
>> Oh, okay. Okay. How about you, Key?
>> I'm in Colorado.
>> Oh, okay. Good. I used to live in
Colorado. Used to live in Aurora,
Colorado.
>> Oh, yeah. I'm not too far from there.
Apparently today's the first day in like
or the most humid day in like almost 17
years
>> for Colorado.
>> Weird facts that I heard today.
>> I couldn't believe it's really hot where
I am too. Where are you, Hope?
>> I'm in South Carolina.
>> Oh, outside of you know about uh hot and
humid weather then.
>> Yes, I do. I do. Yeah, we've been
>> expert
>> almost three years. Yep. It's And this
has been the hottest it's ever been
since we've been here.
>> Oh, yeah. Yeah. I heard that there's a
heat wave
>> going on. We have one more day of it in
my area. Um but yeah, it's supposed to
be some of my friends uh said that the
the city, New York City, is like 100
degrees today.
>> Oh, yeah. Yeah.
>> Yeah. which is not fun when you're in a
city like that because it means if you
have to go into the subway, you're
looking at you're looking at probably
more like 110.
>> Oh my.
>> Yeah. And really, really bad uh air
quality. So, all right, we're getting a
couple more people. Welcome. Hello,
Glenn.
Hello. Is it Jazz?
>> Yes,
>> Jazz.
>> Okay. Just want to make sure. Um I will
get started in two more minutes. So, I'm
going to give people just another couple
of moments to um Enter.
All right.
Um I will get started. So let me see. I
think hope you are the only one who
attended
uh the noon session.
um in this group. So, we'll see who else
might join. But we are picking up with
our LinkedIn Q&A series. So, um this
week we are going to be picking up where
we left off and
um
moving into crafting a compelling
summary.
Um so what we had covered and again um
we'll do just a super super quick um
quick recap about what we've done so
far. So again, welcome back. Um, week
one, a couple of weeks ago, we discussed
why LinkedIn matters and we talked about
LinkedIn's role in the jobs job search,
how recruiters use it. We discussed what
makes a profile great from content to
strategy perspective.
Um, week two, we talked about setting up
the basics and we went from the top
down, right? So, we covered the photos,
contact information, banners,
um how to uh use uh small visual cues to
build trust around um your profile, um
to make sure people know that you're a
real human. Um we did some editing of
our profiles and then last week we
talked a little bit more about writing a
great headline. So we learned what makes
a strong keywordri
headline and we workshopped a bit about
um you know your uh headlines in the
larger group. Today I will be um uh
breaking out uh using breakout rooms
to go over your summary.
help. Kai, welcome back, Kai. Um, since
both of you were in the noon session, I
may put both of you in uh breakout rooms
together. Um, and then see if we'll need
another breakout room and I might
separate you guys. So, we'll just see
how that goes. This is my first time
using breakout rooms, so just be
patient. I know that sounds wild, but I
never had to use a breakout room in uh
Zoom myself before. I've participated.
So, um, you high-tech folks, please,
please be patient. Um, and now this week
we are going to be talking about what
makes a summary work.
So, we'll be talking about um some of
the core elements
um and I'll run through them now. We
discussed this in the noon session. So
clear and confident opening line, a
sense of who you are and what you're
about professionally. Um what you're
working on, what you're looking for, a
sentence of or two that reflects your
personality, your values, uh motivation,
and perhaps a call to action, right?
Which is somewhat optional. Um that
you're open to networking, maybe that
you're hiring. Um you know when you all
become
uh hiring leads uh as uh low code or
full stack developers
you will be tasked to be part of an
interview loop. So you may also post uh
on your LinkedIn profile that you are
now hiring and that is a secret that
actually recruiters use is they will ask
hiring managers to post on their
LinkedIn LinkedIn profile that they are
looking to hire. A lot of times people
will respond to hiring managers who are
software developers rather than to a
recruiter.
So um hiring leads always have uh are
the stars of the show when it comes to
recruiting. So it's always nice to
enlist them as help. Um any questions
so far from anyone at the moment?
Nope. Okay. So, let me actually do this.
I would love to share some LinkedIn
profiles that uh serve as some examples
of um LinkedIn profiles that you should
see and how people have them set up. And
we can look at the summary as well. So,
let me get to sharing my screen.
Can everybody see my screen?
>> Yes.
>> Yes.
>> Perfect. So, this is Max. He is located
in Arizona. He's a machine learning
engineer and tech lead at Amazon.
some folks,
you know, you see his banner, you see
his uh photo, his name, his title. Now,
that's what he used his headline for.
And I have also done that in the past as
well. Uh when I am permanently in a
full-time role, I will note
my title and where I'm working. So once
I get hired, I oftentimes change my
headline. Sometimes I leave it. So it
really depends on
my mood, what I'm feeling like doing.
But you know, when you are employed and
you're at an amazing organization or one
that you are proud of and excited about,
you can list that. Um Melissa has been
working her connections.
Um she is connected with him. I saw her
actually connected to a ton of people
when I was snooping around. But um you
can scroll down and Max has curated his
summary or about section in a different
way um than I have been suggesting. it's
not wrong. Could be something how he
wanted to structure it. Um, but
regardless of his formatting,
you can see that he's been talking about
himself where he is at right now. He's
an experienced staff machine learning
engineer. He's also a technical team
lead with demonstrated history of
leading successful AI ML projects in the
cloud. Um, so now he's really digging in
and talking about his level of
experience and and sort of backing up
that statement, um, what he specializes
in, his proficiency,
um, in the tools that he uses in real
time at this position.
um you know he is scripting and
programming and Python and SQL
um and some of the other framework
expertise that he has. But then what I
like that he did and that he pulled
everything together is his last sess
sess uh last session uh sentence. He's
an avid reader. He has a passion for
learning new tools, techniques, and
technologies, especially those that
bring AI workloads to the cloud. So,
you tell me, you all are the techsavvy
individuals.
I am
getting there with your help. But he
seems to have really honed in on the his
focus area and and that much I like. Now
his top skills are listed in his about
section by default because
check out his skills. And I think that
was something that a lot of uh a few of
you have asked me specifically like how
many skills should I list?
Well,
Max has list 55 alone in um his
experience for uh Amazon and
he is uh choosing to bullet everything
that he's done so far at Amazon. You can
do that. Um I myself do not um because I
feel that it's a little bit redundant
for my um focus area. Um perhaps
when I land a recruitment position at a
tech firm focusing on AI, that is my
goal. uh I will likely uh list what I've
done because it will be very different
than the type of recruiting that I've
done in the past. Um you can see that he
is uh he was at Cognizant for two years
as a senior data engineer lead. He's got
all of his skills listed and you can see
he's bullet point he he's listed in
bullets everything that he did there. Um
and then prior to that he was a research
engineer. He's listed his skills and uh
some bullets as well.
You can see that he is has his um
master's of science at University of
Montana that he highlighted added his
skills there because they were relevant.
Um and he uh went to the University of
Missouri Columbia with his bachelor in
physics listed his skills. Um he became
a a certified machine learning engineer.
um at Amazon and he's listed some other
licenses and certifications.
We can see that here.
I like how he's listed his skills.
Again, super important. They are
searchable.
[Music]
All right.
And then it
he's got uh his honors and awards. One
thing that I don't see are uh
recommendations,
and I would definitely do that.
Now, we have someone of uh a bit more
junior to Max, so not as senior.
Lette I liked because I thought she was
a great example. Um because she is
somewhat um of a
new I would say um
a software engineer. It looks like she's
really stepped into that role somewhat
recently
as you can see here.
And uh Lette has her banner, her
professional photo, her full name, her
title. Now, she just chose to list her
title, which again is is fine. But for
uh from a recruitment perspective and
from a search perspective, I think
having a little bit more uh of a robust
headline uh is a good idea. And now you
can see um her very interesting
uh profile uh or about in summary
section. Um and it talks she actually
seems to have talked a little bit about
um
first where she what led her to tech and
software development. And I think that
she did it in a in a lovely way.
I think I would clean up the
formatting. I'm a little bit of a a
stickler with uh spaces and format. So,
probably would have put a space here and
then ticked this space back to be right
underneath the eye. But again,
I uh the devil is in the details.
But she um she says, "I am a proud
product of life's tumultuous nature.
Through the highs and the lows, I have
learned with every breath. From a young
age, I always knew I had an insatiable
vigor for knowledge. I have succeeded
and I have failed. But one thing remains
constant. I feel through all of my
experiences. I grow closer and closer to
the beautifully elusive idea of who I
want to be." Um,
lovely.
Um, and that is something as a recruiter
I always love to see when someone puts
um who they are. Uh, this uh one
paragraph isn't something that I would
expect from a more tech-savvy
individual.
um
tech folks seem to be a little bit more
precise and um to the point.
She has um
shown who she is uh her more vulnerable
side. Um and I like to see that. So you
can see how she has uh talked about how
her connections have led her to
technology and that it is a platform
that can be uh thought through logically
but approached through an infinite
number of computations.
Um so very interesting way of
formulating her summary. So, I thought
that it was a nice variety to what we've
been constructing and what we've been
seeing. What I also loved is that she is
just like all of you and myself coming
in as a tech recruiter. She is an
associate level and it looks as if she
started as a software engineer
apprentice.
Kai, I am thinking about you, sister.
Look at this. Denver, Colorado.
Uh, air DNA seems interesting and maybe
somewhere um I am going to start
investigating
to start reaching out and uh talking to
their their talent team. Uh but
very nice. She was a yoga instructor and
still is
um at Core Power Yoga and she uh looks
like she uh was a trainee
and uh started off her career as a
specimen processing analyst at LabCore.
Any comments on
the two profiles that I've I've shown so
far?
Okay,
David Gonzalez. So, David
um
he is a software engineer out of
Orlando.
He did not um he didn't uh elaborate
uh his banner. I would have liked to
have seen it. Um, but he also noted his
title, his name, and maybe a photo that
someone took of him. Still looks
professional. And his about section
talks about where he's been, uh, how he
started, his programming experience,
um, he where he started out in terms of
programming languages.
um and how his experiences has guided
him not only uh being a valuable asset
as a programmer but also um uh a team
player and communicator.
I think I would have
tried to separate um myself from others
and
done a little bit more of a uh more
detailed uh summary. Uh I did choose him
because he did use phrases like detail
or oriented and team player.
They're a little bit common. I would
have uh searched and tried to curate
something that was a little bit more
unique in how I articulated that. But
still um the proof is in the pudding. He
is working at Deote and it looks like he
is an automating automation testing
associate. Um it's again someone that is
a little bit more um entry level. uh he
graduated um with his bachelor's in
commut computer science in 2022
and he's
worked his way up.
Yeah.
So personally
and this certainly doesn't give him
any sort of like mark on his LinkedIn
profile. I would have left out the being
a teller and a sales associate,
especially now because he is really
starting to step in to um uh you know a
more ex uh a techfocused organization.
But to be honest, when I was recruiting
for creatives and when I was looking at
profiles of executive creative
directors, which is pretty high up on
the totem pole,
they never update their profile. And
most people do not. Um, I find that a
lot of folks put everything they've got
into their LinkedIn profile and their
resume when they're looking for work,
but then when they
um, you know, when they are
already in a role in there for a few
years,
it kind of falls by the wayside. So, I
would discourage that and I would
encourage you to uh regardless of what
level you are at to keep your LinkedIn
profile uh spiffed up.
He's got his skills in there
and his skills for his um
computer science degree.
And lastly, we've got Jonathan. Jonathan
um from what I recall uh has a somewhat
jazzed up headline, an interesting
profile picture, and he talks about he
is title is software engineer.
You know what? Jonathan got straight to
the point. He wasn't he was fine with
just articulating that he is an
experienced senior software engineer
with a demonstrated history of working
in the internet industry. He's let you
know his skills and um you know where he
is um at an advanced level. He is
fulltime at GitHub and has been for over
a little over four years. Um he's worked
at a few other places in Canada. He was
a soft a software de developer or
software engineer at um realtor.com
and he definitely has put his time in.
Started as a VA at G Inc. Let's take a
look at his um more of his experience.
Okay, he's listed out as a front-end uh
as a software engineer. what he did at
realtor.com
certainly something that you can do. I
personally
all of this I would have put in skills
leaner
and searchable even though yeah these
are are searchable it's um easier on the
eyes I think to have the skills in
again he listed his technologies when it
absolutely could have been put in skills
saying. So, let's clean it up.
QA analyst.
And it looks like that's how he started
his career. Yeah. In low code.
All right.
I will stop sharing. Any questions,
friends?
Is there a
I I've been thinking a lot about sort of
what it means to be sort of simple the
way that you sort of presented that the
more functional
uh
resume but also just like within the
LinkedIn profile.
Um
>> yeah,
>> are there any groups that sort of look
for more verbose?
Because I I like what you're presenting.
I feel like that it it speaks really
well to a sort of the dry uh don't
repeat yourself principles in software,
but it also just feels like a more
organized way of
>> presenting things, which is one of the
challenges I've always had with LinkedIn
is sort of the repetitive nature of,
>> you know, yeah, we do the same thing
from job to job more or less except a
few
>> additional things, you know.
Well, I
LinkedIn
though it is different from your resume
in that it really is something that
shows more who you are and is from the
first person rather than you know the
resume is is not
you know LinkedIn really is for
recruiters, hiring managers and for
employees from other organizations to
connect with each other, right? I am
giving you
information that is coming from myself,
a recruiter who's been recruiting for
over 20 years.
I use LinkedIn
to
look at someone's background quickly
because a lot of the times, most of the
time, I don't receive a resume.
Most of the time someone will send me
their portfolio or their GitHub if I'm
recruiting for tech and any other
projects that folks are proud of that
they um you know want to show. Um, if
it's a systems designer who also works
in experience design, then they are
sending me a portfolio with links to the
platforms that they have designed and
maybe even um systems and and branding
design uh explorations.
Most of the time I'm not seeing a
resume. The resume typically is an
afterthought. Now why the resume and the
LinkedIn profile is so important to all
of you is because you are stepping into
the industry. Even if you are someone
who has focused in low code for the
majority of your career and shifting
more into full stack or full backend
development,
um
you you still want to make sure that um
your resume and LinkedIn profile are
uh compliant with today's technological
um recruitment. ETSs systems. The
reality is now we're dealing with the
technology of AI and I am basically
letting all of you know the secrets
of what recruiters look like and what
applicant tracking systems are picking
up and why it's important in order for
you all to be successful. I want to make
sure that recruiters are seeing your um
your applications that you are uh using
to apply to some of these companies. I
want to make sure that you when
recruiters and hiring leads are looking
at your LinkedIn profile that they're
seeing everything nicely organized so
that they know you've take time and
care.
when you get a little bit further down
the road as a senior,
maybe you won't be as meticulous, but
now is when it really counts, right? So,
I would say the time and place for being
a little bit more verbose and more
descriptive and playful in your LinkedIn
profile and your summary is down the
road when you're employed
and and you're where you kind of feel
comfortable in your career. Does that
make sense?
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah.
>> Absolutely.
Glenn, Jess, Hope, Key, how do you guys
feel about that? Does that make sense?
>> Yeah, it does. I mean, because we're
we're trying to land a job. We're not
So, we don't want to be cuty. We want to
be, you know, professional and to the
point.
>> Yeah. And I just, you know, I feel also
that
more techfocused individuals and hiring
leads and recruiters, they're less about
the way that you tell a story. What
they're looking for is okay, this person
has the uh frame database framework
technologies down. Okay, yeah, they they
have, you know, the HTML, the CSS, the
Python. This is exactly what we're
looking for. They have React. Okay,
great. Let me reach out to this person
so then you can tell the story.
It's I think that
for
folks that are more, you know, design
focused, copy focused, art direction
focused, maybe even UX UI focused
that as a recruiter,
I want to see the pretty stuff.
And to tell you the truth, as a tech
recruiter,
I will likely want to see the pretty
stuff, like the result of what what your
code produced. And then I'll want to
know how you interacted with those teams
that produced this beautiful work.
But I'm going to be more focused on
the code. what you know
can you pass the technical interview how
much I'm preparing you for the technical
interview
>> can I just ask you something
>> sure
>> um so I have uh over 20 years experience
and uh excuse me so I experienced well I
have a gap of almost two years now doing
all this development etc because I was I
I had a child. So um I experienced that
because I'm I was data analyst and
business analyst the system analyst and
I worked with data on almost every
project but I'm also business analyst.
I'm actually uh going to sit the exam
for it's CBEP it's a certificate for
business analyst but I experienced that
recruiters will just uh uh see me as
data analyst if they are looking for
just pure business analyst and they will
just disregard me that's basically what
what I was told oh you're too data
focused and it's not like that I have
just a lot of experience I have I used
to be developer just pure developer in
the like in the first 10 years of my
career career. So um and um again um
doing this course and I'm I'm quite a I
did use Python over years and and quite
a it's quite an interesting use of AI
definitely interested in that. So what
would you do if I So I'm actually
working on LinkedIn summary and uh like
I don't know what to say about um
like I I asked Chad GPD please include
business transformation and datadriven
transformations and the sentence is open
to contract or permanent roles globally
remote or or on site where I can
contribute to datadriven and business
transformation initiatives. Is that does
that give me opportunity to work on both
business analyst roles and data analyst
roles or is it just so hard to be so um
diverse in terms of which roles are and
and another question is what should I do
about my break so definitely first year
after the child was born I did I didn't
really do well I did study blockchain
which is in vain basically basically
nobody's interested in blockchain. Um,
which I thought would help me find a
job, but actually didn't. So, I
constantly do things besides caring for
for child. Of course, now I'm more free.
Um, but it it's somehow that gap is is
very very
glaring. It's I don't know. I still get
interviews, but I'm not getting job for
months.
Sorry.
>> Yeah, but I don't think that that is the
reason. Um, you know, I
you you can note breaks on your resume
and I would encourage that
>> to to to just the words just broke. Did
you say I should note the breaks?
>> Um, yeah. I I would I would list
whatever break you took
>> on your resume. And it doesn't have to
elaborate and say why,
but to account for that time. You can do
that. And I think Jez, what where are
what phase are you in in this program
>> in this particular program? I just
started
two three weeks ago. So
>> ah okay. So you are fresh and you just
started. I am but I'm also doing this
CBA preparation to do the the
certificate and I'm also doing the which
again would deter some people looking
for data analyst that I'm doing a
business analyst certificate really
annoying and I'm also I also enrolled
with some MIT course which is uh which
will start in in later this year but
it's I'm already enrolled which is about
AI machine learning tools from
perspective
>> okay
>> of more use of that not development So,
I'm quite interested in all of that. It
just uh Yeah. Sorry, I'm just
explaining.
>> Can you do me a favor? Yeah. No, no,
it's not a problem. Can you do me a
favor and message me your um your
LinkedIn uh profile link on Discord? So,
send that link over to me. And also, I
wouldn't mind taking a look at your
resume, although uh I know that Dr.
Emily would will want me to pause on
doing like a one-on-one screen with you
and revising your resume because you've
just started the program. So, she will,
you know, it really I'm supposed to
she's asked that I start that kind of
focused work one- on-one with folks that
are uh at the tail end of the internship
and moving into junior developer.
Okay.
I'm I'm
>> I would like to Yes,
>> I'm attending this development uh
sessions this week. Uh it started the it
will be throughout the week until
Friday. So, um I'm doing everything I
can to uh get up to speed with GitHub
and Python, which I already know. Um uh
but what I don't know is uh how to use
AI tools with this and so yeah.
>> All right. Well, definitely send me your
the link to your LinkedIn profile and
your
>> How do I find you?
>> How do I find you? I see you're there
listed like they have a
>> Yep.
>> I'm on Discord and it says I believe uh
it Yeah, I'm Chelsea.
>> Chelsea. Okay. All right. Thanks. Yeah,
I don't have any any nicknames. I
thought that was too confusing.
>> Yes.
>> Sounds fine. Thanks.
>> Yes, of course. So, send that over. Um,
so, you know, some of the best practices
that we went over uh in the noon session
is, you know, being having an o open
with a strong concise sess uh sentence.
So, who you are, what you do, what
you're working toward. Use plain
confident language. And as I said, avoid
buzzwords and filler, right? Like the
results driven and seasoned. You you
want to write like a human who
understands their work. This is not a
press release. Okay. Um uh mention
methodologies and and technologies that
you use, problems you love solving, you
know, recent projects. Reflect your
learning uh or a growth path especially.
You know, that is especially helpful for
early career or even self-taught
developers. It's okay to show you're
growing as long as you're proactive
about it. Um, and add a personal or
human touch, a line about how you think,
what drives you, or why tech excites
you, and helps make it and it helps to
make your summary more real and and more
memorable. Um, so the final few minutes,
um, uh, because we have a little over 10
minutes, what I would like to do is
break you out in rooms to discuss the
summaries that you currently have, maybe
come up with a couple of ideas.
So let me
let me see one.
All right.
There you go.
Yeah.
Hello. How'd it go?
>> Good.
>> I think it was constructive.
>> Who wants to share?
>> Well, I can share. Um Kai helped me out.
He um I I
shared with him what I put into Groank
and what they sped out to me. And I had
a lot of it was it was a lot. And then
he showed me like what his resume looked
like, not not his GitHub, but his his um
resume. And it was, you know, more
concise. And so you he gave me some tips
as to how to um you know pair it down
and use a lot of those things that um
put more skills as opposed to I was
actually gave me information about
everywhere I worked or most of some of
the places I worked and what I did
there. So
yeah so it was good. Good. Did you come
up with any sentences or anything that
you feel you can utilize to construct
your summary?
>> Oh yes, it gave a lot of you know it
gave a lot of um and there were some
buzzwords but you know I mean I think
that's what they do. I didn't say don't
use buzzwords. I don't know if it would
would say like what do you mean what's a
buzz word? But I I'm sure you know it's
pretty smart.
>> No, you you definitely do that. Yeah. Oh
my god.
>> The Yeah. The thing with AI and you like
it's like you really do have to be very
descriptive.
>> Okay.
>> And very precise. Yeah. I mean when I am
using AI to craft really anything or um
you know when I've been working on you
know for instance I I worked on uh Kai's
resume
um he I I
reworked and tweaked the summary uh a
few times um because I really like
something u substantial um and I like to
have something um you know to work with,
right? And then I can always pair things
down. But I wrote in do not use words
like
and then I put in quotes seasoned,
detail oriented, like every word that I
did not want to see, I listed it. I also
uh said to
um you know that that I wanted a
professional but warm tone.
I said that I wanted to
include Kai's
previous architecture
experience because it is relevant. Um,
and yeah, I get very very descriptive.
Like the more descriptive you are when
you're using an AI tool, the better it
is.
>> Okay. All right. Thank you.
>> You're welcome.
Any who else wants to talk about what
they've come up with?
Oh, come on.
No one.
>> Well, I can briefly share. I think uh we
kind of weren't on the right track. I
think we we we were talking about our
LinkedIn like about section rather than
like our um resume um summary, which I
think
>> yeah,
>> is a little bit different, but all of us
had uh a little blurb already. Um, and I
know for me specifically, it was like
when I first became a junior dev and
basically I just knew I wanted a job and
I was wanting to be working as a
developer and that was as like far as I
got as far as like what I wanted and you
know what skills I wanted to utilize to
get there. Um,
>> so I don't have any like specific
phrases or anything, but it was
definitely we were talked about like
making sure to add like a, you know,
sentence or two about the kind of like
company atmosphere and type. Um, because
I know I want like a company that has
like a mission to help um, you know,
like a community or you know, something
and I want that
>> like a purpose. So you're looking for a
purpos driven community.
>> Yeah. So organization.
>> Yeah. To to add that in there as well as
like be a little bit more specific on
the role that I'm looking for now that I
I don't have to be quite as like generic
of just a software engineer. I can like
specify more of the tools that I'd like
to use and and get that updated.
Yeah. I mean, I I am looking at yours
now. That's great. I mean, you have um
you you went a little bit deeper and I
feel like you changed this a little bit
than when I first started a couple years
or a couple weeks ago.
>> I don't think I've changed this robust,
>> I guess. Okay.
>> Okay.
Yeah, I mean I think that this is I
think that this is is great if this is
how you know it's searchable. You
mentioned your skills. You talk about um
what you are currently uh focused on.
I might rethink results driven where it
says I'm a results driven software
developer just like you know trying to
pull those
buzzwords.
>> Yeah. Yeah. This was definitely like
basically made with you know AI like
chat GPT and dumped in there because at
the time I didn't know what it was
>> to do. So, like changing the personality
of it and like the tone to make it more
mine is kind of where I'm at. Um,
>> yeah. Yeah, I like it.
And you can take this and let's I don't
know for funsies. Let's just see what it
says. Um, let me see.
Um
>> yeah, the plan was absolutely to go back
into to AI and tell, hey, take this and
update it with like this these
specifics, right? You know?
>> Yes.
All right. I'm going to quickly just jot
something in here. So, write this about
section of my LinkedIn.
All right. So,
I was a little bit lean with what I was
asking it to do, but
let's see what uh
what my little AI platform comes up
with. Oh, interesting.
Okay.
Kept course skills. All right. So this
is a little more condensed
but this is what it had to say and I'll
put it in the chat after but full stack
software developer react next js
typescript post grql I don't know if I'm
saying that properly
>> postgress
>> ci
thank you c i slash cd I am a full stack
developer focused on building scalable
maintainable software with a strong
foundation in React, Nex.js and
Typescript. I enjoy working in agile
environments where clean code,
thoughtful collaboration, and continuous
improvement drives process. At Techjoy
Software, I contribute to feature
development, database optimization, and
test coverage improvements across a
growing suite of applications. I also
mentor aspiring developers at Joy of
Coding Academy, helping them
troubleshoot code, strengthen their
problem solving skills, and navigate the
early stages of their tech careers.
Always open to connecting with other
developers, collaborators, and building
uh and teams building things that
matter.
>> That's Yeah, I like that.
>> That's what I think. You like that?
Yeah.
>> Well done. I'm gonna put that in the
chat.
So, and you know what? I just kind of
like encourage all of you to
um
to play with it. You know what I mean?
because it does take that kind of
um it it's it's not just
like oh let me put this in and see what
I you know and see what I can come up
with okay great there it is copy paste
like you also need to put a little bit
of your
in it right
there you go
there you are Kai and it also does or
key Sorry. It also doesn't mean that you
have to use this if I send it out.
>> I mean, honestly, you can you can toss
whatever I say and do your own thing.
This is just from a recruiter's
perspective.
um and and will allow
the search capability in different AI
platforms and applicant tracking systems
and uh the source. It will allow for
sourcing to be a little bit um more just
fluid and easier uh for the recruiter,
which will allow you to be seen. Bye,
Jazz.
Um
yeah. So
it takes some time um maybe this uh
weekend, this week whenever you have a
moment to put some some attention to it.
Um and
you know may even uh ask other members
who could not attend this session what
they think. um because I think it's just
it's it's a good way to collaborate to
get other people's thoughts um maybe
even spark some ideas
and we will revisit this and continue
building on on LinkedIn and there will
be you know there's we got a whole lot
of time together so we'll be talking
about um interviewing we'll be looking
at um
job descriptions and how to
craft uh or tailor your resume for each
job description which you should be
doing. It is laborious. It is time
consuming
but you know the résumés that we
construct are merely templates
to AB test your LinkedIn profile. Oh
gosh. Um that's a good question.
um like to test and see if it aligns
with uh AI
some of the applicant tracking systems.
>> Yeah. I mean just to like I mean I
thought of this earlier when Katrina had
asked the question about what to do
because she was talking about her
profile being so broad
>> and then I started thinking
>> uh you apply to a job and you look you
you'll make little changes and you'll
think hm maybe this is more geared
towards that other job I was applying
towards. You know, wouldn't it be great
if there's a way to
have a version of your profile that is
you can just sort of see cuz once you
change your profile, you start to get
recruiters messaging you. At least it
see I feel like that. And I feel like
sometimes I start to get more recruiters
messaging me that are in the tech field
versus the architecture field. And I
just I never know what was it that I
changed, if anything.
>> Yeah. I mean, I think that
it it might not I don't think that it's
you changed your LinkedIn profile and
you got more recruiters. Um I I I mean
it is it is sort of half of that but
it's also you are probably applying to
jobs. You're you know getting on
people's radar. Maybe they're taking a
look at your LinkedIn profile. Um and
there's a way to for you to see Did I
put my hand up?
>> Yeah. Um, there is a way to to look and
see who's viewing your profile. Do you
all know how to do that?
>> No. Is that's only if you're a paid
member. Is that correct?
>> No.
>> Really?
>> Pretty sure.
>> I don't know that.
>> Did you show us, Chelsea?
>> Yeah. Yep. I'll show you. Let me pull up
my LinkedIn. Hold on. Let me pull it up.
All right.
So,
in notifications,
I believe, let me share my screen really
quick.
Yeah, that's where we're Is it?
Yeah, share that.
Come on.
All right. So, can you all see
Yes. Okay. Very good. Wow, this is
taking a long time. Okay.
Okay.
So, I see a notifications.
So when you go into just, you know, your
feed,
click notifications
and it gives you all of
this information mostly on things that
you've commented on or different
positions that I may be uh jobs that I
may be open to. If you sort of subscribe
to view those jobs and get those jobs
lit that listing emailed to you then you
will see that and then oh I can view
those jobs and if I commented on
someone's post so you can scroll down
let me find some one that's a little bit
more robust.
Let me see.
Talent specialist. No, a bunch of
people.
You can just kind of scroll and
might not have it here.
You see it up at the top though. Okay.
So, says someone with the job title
recruiter viewed your profile. See all
views.
So you can click on that.
>> Hold on.
>> Yes sir.
>> And then it shows
who's viewed your profile.
>> You have about 10 minutes.
>> Okay.
>> So it says 10 recruiters viewed your
profile.
Um
Greg Tucker viewed my profile. Someone
from Sacred Heart University.
Rachel, David, Melissa was was checking
me out,
a business strategist at FCB New York
where I worked. So, you can just kind of
see. Now, just so you know, and I have
the same thing as a recruiter, I have
blocked
views for others to see if I've looked
at their profile.
Most recruiters do that. That's why it
says 10 recruiters and it'll say
um from Apple and other companies and I
could like this but it's not really
going to give me any real information.
>> I don't get that view by the way. Um, it
I don't have premium and it has it
basically blurred out.
>> Like it tells you that there's people
and roughly the industry,
>> but it's all blurred and behind a pay
wall.
>> Yeah. So
I subscribe to premium because I am
looking for to add more work for myself
in addition to te techjoy academy. So I
did join premium. I would when you are
all hot and heavy on the job hunt, I do
recommend premium because you will also
be filtered more uh job opportunities.
Most job platforms are like that. So
there is you kind of have to be
strategic
in where you're looking.
>> Okay.
Uh, I also use Indeed and I will likely
be investigating other um
platforms. Now, you can also research
the companies that you're really excited
about and then go to
um, I don't know, let's say Meta
just for funsies, right?
And I think that um Miles actually did a
video on this.
So we will go to meta
look at the companies page
and then you'll see jobs
oftent times will look here first and
say okay
great yeah there's a bunch roles here.
You can
Oh, those are Oh, sorry, wrong one.
And then you can see all of Meta's jobs.
Or better yet, just go to the website.
Let me do that here.
So,
the ins and outs of LinkedIn and other
job boards, but um we are over time.
Thank you so much. If any of you have
any specific questions,
um your husband is ready to eat dinner.
Fair enough, Hope. So is my husband, but
he's making dinner.
>> Yes, he is. My husband is, too. Why put
stuff in the oven?
>> Bless his heart.
>> Yes. Yeah,
>> crack the whip. Hope crack the whip. And
Kai was was putting a baby to sleep at
noon. So

much. If you've got any specific
questions, I am a Discord message away.
