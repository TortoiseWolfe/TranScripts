https://youtu.be/r7gcooU_XBs

Hey there, Mindy.
>> Good morning. Where is everybody?
>> I don't know. I uh I didn't send my
announcement in Discord. I had a little
bit of a hectic morning.
>> Oh. Oh,
>> well, I appreciated the the resume
template that you sent me. It's
beautiful.
Thank you very much.
>> Excellent.
>> This good. I'm a little I'm a little
sleepy myself, but I needed to to get up
and get moving because I haven't heard
back from the recruiter. Oh, we've got
Hope coming in. Well, that's good. Hi,
Hope.
>> Hi. How are you?
>> Doing okay. Yourself?
>> Very good. Thank you.
>> Trying to get my headphones connected
here.
>> Just on a buy the buy thing. Um, I told
my sister that I wanted to do a
professional portrait and I need to go
get I I want to go get the makeup thing.
I want to do it after I have somebody do
the makeup because I'm not good at
makeup. I know that. Okay. So, we have
some pictures that she took. Well, that
they they took the the people doing the
Disneyland things. so you can get your
picture taken throughout. Very, very
happy. Anyway, she took the picture and
she did some doctoring on it and she's
like, "What about this?" And she sent it
to me and I'll see if I can share,
but
I like this pretty much. Um, I don't
know if you can see that. Nope, not
much. So, I'll see if I can send it. But
it looks pretty nice. And
>> Mindy, Mindy, just put it straight up in
front of your face
and take it bring it closer to the to
your camera.
>> It's getting blurry though, right?
>> Yeah, it is.
Oh, I see it. Oh, yeah. There you go.
Mhm. Very good. very good.
>> She's like, I can do the filter thing
for you. And I was like,
we'll see. I mean, at least it could it
would make a difference for right now.
It's not, you know, cropping it and such
would be pretty good. And she's I could
do some things. And I'm going, okay,
we'll see what we can do. Cuz
>> I would like to get a professional
picture taken, but I don't want to spend
a lot of money on it right now. It just
it's a lot of stuff and I need to get
and my haircut was pretty much the same
as what I'm doing now. So,
she's like, I could do that. It would
look more it would look pretty
professional. Going, okay, we'll see.
So, I like that one. Turned out pretty
nice. She says, "I have fun playing."
She says, "I have fun dressing my I I'm
playing with you like you're a paper
doll. I'm going to um
I'm going to post clothes on you and
that kind of stuff. Anyway, Chelsea,
since you're since we have another
person, I'll let you take back your
meeting if you'd like."
>> Yeah. No, no problem. Um, I am actually
just getting a posting out now on
Discord. Thank you for your patience.
Um,
>> I can barely hear you, Chelsea.
>> I I can just barely hear you.
>> I don't know why.
>> Okay.
>> I don't know. Maybe get uh
put the volume up. I don't know. Well, I
have closed caption on so I can read
what you're saying.
>> Okay. Very good. Very good.
>> And I put transcript up, too.
>> And there's Gino driving again. He's on
the road again.
>> Yep. I'm at it again.
>> Well, welcome Gino. Good to have you.
Keep your eyes on
>> Glad to be here.
So, um, today we are at week 12 and we
are going to be talking about leverage.
>> It's interesting because I had a whole
bunch of media call me. Uh,
>> my phone just started going off. I
apologize.
>> Oh, that was you. Okay.
>> Okay. Um, so we are going to be talking
about leveraging LinkedIn for research.
Um, and now
I'd like all of you to think about
something while I start reviewing what
we've done for the past 11 weeks. So,
what is one thing you've used LinkedIn
for in the past week? So, just think
about it. Don't don't blurt anything
out. Don't say anything, but you know,
think about it a little bit. So
we have done a lot together in the past
11 weeks, right? So we've
uh you know weeks one through five,
we've discussed why LinkedIn matters,
profile basics, summary, skills,
projects, education, custom URL,
settings.
Um week six and seven we really dove
deep into building your network. So
connecting and keeping relationships
warm authentically.
Week eight we discussed messaging and
cold outreach.
Week nine recommendations.
And week 10 engaging with the platform.
to posts, comments, hashtags.
And then just last week, we talked about
job alerts and and creating our filters
so that we allow LinkedIn to do some of
the work for us and send uh the most
updated,
the most recent jobs posted delivered
right to your inbox.
So,
which one of these
have you actually put into practice and
what results did you see?
So, Mindy, let's start with you.
>> Well, I added some more connections this
week. I updated
according to our meeting. I made the few
updates in the posts to that and I've
reached out to a few recruiters with
haven't reached out to a lot but the
ones that I thought looked interesting
and I used the resume that I had but now
um we have a new template so things are
going to be moving even faster and I got
oh and I've got to reach out again
through LinkedIn because the one that
said they were going to call me back
never did. So I got to find out what
happened the followup as one does. So
all good stuff.
>> All right. Very nice. Very nice. So
we've talked about the results that
you've seen as well. Hope. How about
you? Which of these have you put into
practice and then what results have you
seen so far if any?
Well, um I've connected with some more
people, reached out and connected and
then I
f I started following a couple people,
you know, I clicked on follow for some
people and I think even made a response
to them, you know, just a personal
response. I didn't post to them, but I
said I um I was interested or said
something like that. Uh, I I kind of
like a thumbs up type thing. I didn't
put a thumbs up, but basically words is
saying thumbs up. Just a real short
paragraph, a very short sentence. I
enjoyed your your post. Interesting.
Something like that.
>> Great. Great. Excellent. Okay. Very
good.
>> And and one of them two of them were
recruiters and one was just someone who
just had an interesting post.
>> Okay. Excellent. Excellent.
>> Um, hey Leo, welcome. We were just
talking a little bit about what we're
going to cover this week in in uh lesson
uh session A uh and B pretty much for
the most part it'll be the same uh
coverage but leveraging LinkedIn for
research and I just asked a question and
I'll throw it out to you as well. um
since we've gone through weeks 1 through
11 and you've pretty much been attending
since the very beginning and as you know
week 1 through five we did all of the
why LinkedIn matters and sort of setting
up the profile we've done the networking
messaging cold call outreach
recommendations job alerts and filters
which of these have you actually put
into practice this and what results have
you seen so far, if any? And this is for
you, Leo.
>> Well, I've definitely did the email
thing, so I have a constant input of
jobs being sent to me for me to apply to
every day.
>> There you go.
>> I've been doing my connections for each
and every job I apply to. go to that
company's specific thing to try and
outreach to a recruiter if they're
listed on LinkedIn and available to
connect.
>> Yeah. Yeah.
>> And once connected, send a message to
them obviously.
>> Beautiful.
>> With both the relevant company job and
like referencing that AI applied to X
position at that company.
>> Yep. Yep. Beautiful. Have you received
any feedback from anyone just yet?
>> Um, a little bit here and there and
whatnot. Like if I remember correctly,
uh, kind of a intellectual figure from
Emily that she said while I was doing
this before. It's like about 10ish%
would actually come back to me and most
would just be ignored.
>> Yep. True that. True that. Yeah. Or
a lot of times recruiters will get to
those messages on their day off
>> or when they have some,
>> you know,
later.
>> Yeah.
>> Later, I suspect and let's definitely
touch base on this and see if it
happens. the week between or the time
between Thanksgiving
and then the new year,
>> that's when recruiters like clean house.
They get organized for the new year.
They empty out their messages, start
responding to people, seeing if there
are any the needles in the haystack kind
of thing.
>> So, let's uh I'll be interested to see
if anyone checks in with you. Thank you,
Leo. Uh, Gino, I know that you're
driving, but any any of the things that
maybe you've heard in some of these
sessions? I don't know if you've gotten
a chance to look at any of the
recordings of previous Q&As's, but just
curious.
>> Not as of yet, but I have 11 hours of
content to watch this.
>> All right. So, you're you're getting
your popcorn ready.
>> Yep.
>> Yeah. Okay, cool. Um, all right. So,
researching and using LinkedIn as a tool
for research really is going to be your
superpower.
So, LinkedIn is more than a resume or
your digital resume. It's a database of
companies, people's people, sorry, and
opportunities. So, if you learn to
research effectively,
you'll always be ahead of the average
job seeker. Okay? So, leveraging
LinkedIn for research.
So you can
break into three resource categories and
I'll give you a few examples. Right?
So you can do a company research by
looking up your target company and going
to their page.
go to the people tab so that you can see
alumni, recruiters,
employees with relevant titles like you
know what Leo has been doing as well as
sounds like both you know hope and and
many you all have been doing this as
well. But
looking at
the
recruiters and and hiring leads or folks
with relevant titles that you really
think that you want to connect with.
Have any of you gone to groups
yet and gotten like a full stack
developer group or some sort of other
coding group or QA group and maybe
started seeing
uh relevant titles, employees,
recruiters from that end. That's also
another good way to do it and is kind of
underneath that company search umbrella.
But
you can see if a company is hiring
aggressively or even shrinking before
you apply by reviewing
the people, seeing if people are turning
around, seeing what the attrition is at
those companies, seeing if people are
there for only a few months, only a
year. Like there might be reasons not
just by the employees valition. So
really taking a look and seeing what
utilizing the insights tab on that
company page, looking at the growth
trends, locations, headcount, what jobs
they have open. It's all listed there.
You can also look uh search by role and
career path research, search job titles,
full stack developer or QA engineer.
Now you review profiles of people
currently in those roles and then you
can kind of go down rabbit hole, right?
So, it's not just
you can look for people with those
titles, but then if there's someone that
you stumble on and maybe you're into
their GitHub or they list their
portfolio and you're really intrigued by
the work that they've highlighted, you
can start also looking at their page and
looking at what they've posted. Start
commenting on their post but also pay
attention
to where they have been working
previously.
Look at what their career should
trajectory has been.
See if there are differences or
similarities and maybe even start
researching other companies that you
didn't know about by looking at other
places.
those people have worked at. So you can
really start expanding your mind looking
at what groups they belong to.
You can do a recruiter and hiring
manager search.
You can look for
uh filter by job title in the people
section.
You can search technical recruiter
plus the plus sign target the target
agency.
You can do technical recruiter all in
caps and
target company. And we'll get into a
little bit more of this in just a
moment. This is called a bullying search
and it's something that recruiters live
by, right? So, what trends do you
noticed in skills or background when
you're doing the role career path
research?
These are things that you can pay
attention to.
You know, follow them, engage with
posts, or connect with a tailored note
just like we've been talking about.
So,
let's do a little bit of an interactive
activity for about 10 minutes. Gino,
keep driving. Um,
what? Let's let's do a recruiter or
hiring manager search.
So, let's do that first.
So
go to your
search tab up at the top
and
put in technical recruiter in quotes.
Okay.
Then after the quote space
the word and a n and d all in caps
space
and then a target company that you want
to work for.
And then press enter and see what you
might come up with.
And now, so here's what here's all of it
to do. I'm going to put it in the chat
so that you can refer to this.
So there's three things here that I'd
like you to do.
So identify a recruiter or hiring
manager.
One insight about
company growth from the company that
you're targeting
and then identify one person
in a role that you're targeting from
that target.
We'll talk about it and give you guys 7
to 10
I don't know how to get to I've got I've
got a recruiter or a hiring manager up.
I don't know how to get to one insight
about company growth and one person in a
target role. And I can share my screen
if you'd like.
Would you like
I can't hear you. You're muted.
>> So sorry about that. Um I can
I can forward you
uh or I can share my screen.
>> Okay, that would work.
>> Yeah, it's probably easier if I do it
with my screen. Let's see what we've got
here. Hey.
All right, so
Okay. Can everyone see my screen? Yeah.
All right. So
let me see
what role what company
should let's just go here. I was looking
at this company the yesterday.
It looks like a couple of people have
been applying there.
So really it's about looking up the
company.
Okay. And here you can see the groups.
So,
um, if this doesn't look like it
correlates here, but it gives you groups
maybe that are similar and you can look
through this if it actually aligns.
Then you go to the company
and typically the insights you'll see
this tab right here.
Sorry I think it's thank you. Okay. So
so to what was your first question
Mindy? you were looking at looking for
>> well you said one insight about company
growth
>> okay click here on insights
>> oh okay let me see if I've got that on
this person
um
>> and then you it's not the person it's
>> right it's on the company
>> yeah so you go to the company page
>> okay And you can see the company has had
131% growth in the past six months. So
>> that's very promising, especially in
this market, right?
>> Yeah.
>> And since August of 2025 alone,
they've had 159 hires.
That's good growth there.
That's how you'll see it. And then you
can even go a little bit further
and look at the type of of openings that
they've had. Looks like the bulk has
been within engineering.
>> And then you can look
>> um
total employees
and then you can actually see the
headcount.
And then
some of the alumni
looks like they're working at other
places, but you can see that the titles
that they've held and at the companies
they've held it.
>> Okay?
>> They all look like they're DMI alone.
And it gives even some more insights
and even better look at their
competitors
more investigating and you might may
want to follow these companies too
because if you're applying to jobs at
DMI, chances are you're might be
qualified for some positions here. And
look at Advantage Solutions. They've got
a lot of employees
now.
The
>> Thank you.
>> You're welcome. And then you said
something about researching an
individual, right?
I can't remember what I wrote and I I'm
off of the chat. So,
>> you wrote one person in a target role.
>> Okay. Let's look at people.
Sorry, a little slow today.
All right.
So these are sort of some more
demographics
now. Yeah, you can look at them this way
and I would say maybe Sam S, a senior
software engineer if you're looking to
be a software engineer might be, you
know, a good place to start. But also,
we've got Elizabeth Kirk. She's a talent
acquisition specialist.
Connecting with her
That would be smart, right?
And then you can even click show more
results and you'll get a longer list.
Now, I prefer to do this a different
way.
Um, here's another senior talent
acquisition specialist. the way that
just with my eyes and the way that I
process information,
I prefer
to look at employees this way. So,
here's DMI, what they do, where they're
located, how many followers.
I go here to look at the employees
typically.
uh talent acquisition and HR usually at
the beginning like the first and second
pages.
I can see where for all of you I I can
see where this may be very
um overwhelming
for someone who is a nonrecruiter.
I I like having it listed and I like
going through all the pages.
That's just me. But you can look at the
titles here.
Now, another thing that you can do,
let's go back.
You look at their jobs as well.
Okay. And here are their recently
posted jobs.
IT operations manager three days ago.
Technical writer PM
lead PM
And then you can also go to show all
jobs and it'll bring you to all of the
positions that they have open. And now
we're going back to our lesson from last
week. If you're like, I'm really
interested in this company, you know,
I'd really really love to
receive
job alerts when they have these
positions open. So, I'm going to set my
alert and you can look at everything
here.
Yes. Hope
>> um on your LinkedIn when it has a number
like third, second, what does that mean?
>> Um it's how you know those people like
and how you're connected to them. So
first connections
are typically people that you interact
with frequently on LinkedIn who you know
well who you've worked with who you've
gone to school with. Second uh
connections are you know typically folks
that you don't know so well. Maybe you
work with them at an agency but maybe
not on the same team or in the same
group.
Okay. Third,
you're kind of separated.
You you don't know them. You've never
worked with them. You've never worked at
the same company together. So that's
that's the gist of it.
Okay. Okay. Any
other questions?
Oh,
now
so
I would like to quickly cover
uh boolean searching on LinkedIn. So
this will
allow you to understand what a boolean
search is, why it matters in job hunting
and how to use it on LinkedIn to find
recruiters, roles, professionals faster.
Okay. So when you search on LinkedIn, so
here's a question for all of you. When
you search on LinkedIn, do you ever feel
like you get too many results and don't
that that don't fit what you want? Does
that happen to all of you?
You get a lot of results from the search
that
you ask and then you're like, is this
even what I asked for?
Mindy was nodding her head. Okay, so
that's where Boolean searches come in.
It helps you control the search results
and instead of letting LinkedIn decide
for you. So
what is a bullet search? Does anybody
know?
>> We use them all the time. you get a true
or a false for each of the conditions if
they and the ones with true are the ones
that we should be experiencing. So like
we just had with link uh with recruiter
and um I I've forgotten the search that
we put in but it was recruiter and
something else. So yeah.
>> Y the target company. So yes, boolean
search
uses what we call operators. So words
like, and or, not,
quotation marks, parentheses,
all of those operators
are used to refine results.
It's a logicbased way of telling
LinkedIn exactly what to include or
exclude.
Recruiters like me use boolean searching
every day to find talent.
Job seekers can use it to research
recruiters,
companies, and people in target roles.
So
for example
uh
say we want to search for a recruiter at
Google.
If you put recruiter Google,
LinkedIn will show any profile with the
word recruiter
or Google in their profile. It won't
necessarily be a recruiter at Google.
results can be messy.
But when you do when you write recruiter
and in all caps
followed by Google,
it should show only recruiters who work
at Google.
Much cleaner.
So
let's play around with this a little
bit. Okay. So
I am going to introduce these operators
and
one at a time with examples of searches
of searches on LinkedIn. So the word and
and must include both terms. And let me
give you an example,
software developer
and
Amazon.
If you type
software engineer in quotes
then and
Then Amazon,
only software engineers at Amazon would
show up.
Would you like me to
do it and share my page?
>> Yes, please.
>> This
Okay, let me go back to my homepage.
Okay,
let's do it. Oops.
