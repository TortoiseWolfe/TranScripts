I the Glenn.
>> Hello.
Hello everyone. Just giving um couple
more minutes
to kick this off.
I think we've got some new folks here
that were not in my 12:00 session.
So, give just a little bit more time.
>> Yeah, I'm sorry. I was at work. I just
saw in a in a notice here that uh that
was part one earlier in the day. This is
part two.
>> Yes, correct. But it's all right. Um
I'll review
um I will re uh review what we we went
through
>> um in the first session. So no worries
there.
>> Wonderful.
>> Will these be available in replay form?
I see it's being recorded. Yeah.
>> Yes. Great.
>> Yes, sir.
>> Wonderful.
>> By the way, welcome on board.
>> Yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much.
>> My people in
Hey
Glenn, I like your background.
>> I know. I was just gonna say that.
>> The boys. That's Gron is the tan one and
um Ju Guu is the black one. He's the one
Marie home.
>> A look at these babies. Oh god.
Oh. All right.
Martina says Christina Katrina says I
look like Seus here because I have the
two dogs and me in the middle
what you say around me.
>> All right, I'm going to give it one more
minute.
Um, but for those of you who do not know
who I am, I am Chelsea Scott. I am one
of the new um or a new uh career coach
focusing on um the job hunt,
recruitment, resume writing, all this
stuff. Um so
this week, today I am kicking off our uh
job hunt session with uh LinkedIn and
online presence.
So
see
okay um this session is really designed
to
help you build a strong authentic
LinkedIn present that supports your job
search goals as uh junior mid and even
senior developers. This really is for
all levels. Um, this session will
include um a detailed mini training
followed by some live coaching a and
feedback and we'll kind of blend all of
that in uh as we go along. Um, and
again, this is kicking off something
that I'm doing an 18week session. So, on
Tuesdays at noon will be part one. Uh,
Tuesdays at 6 will be part two. But I am
going to try to be very cohesive and
clear in what I'm telling you so that we
can move on a little bit to the part two
uh that I have designed. So
um let's first just start with how is
everyone? Is everyone having a great
day?
I love looking at these dogs. It's
making me very happy.
Everyone good?
>> I can turn the dogs off if you distract
me.
>> No, leave them up.
>> So,
week one. Here we are. Why LinkedIn
matters, right? So
this is really to help you understand
why LinkedIn is essential and how it
plays a unique role in your job search
beyond résumés and applications.
So I have some, you know, talking points
that I want to run through. And really
the first thing is, and something that I
want all of you to understand is
LinkedIn is a recruiter's first stop,
believe it or not. Um, once they get a
brief from the hiring lead, they have
approval from finance to hire. Um,
they've got a job description to work
off of. They know exactly what they're
looking for. they've looked internally
to see if there's anyone that doesn't
have bandwidth and needs to
take on more. Um they we will look
internally first and then we'll commence
but 95% of recruiters and hiring
managers use LinkedIn daily to source
talent. Even if you, you know, apply
through a job board,
they'll often check your LinkedIn before
reaching out. They want to see who you
are and how you represent yourself. It
really serves as your public resume and
reputation all in one.
So,
it helps LinkedIn helps you get found.
So, LinkedIn is is a strong uh presence
and increases visibility and networking
opportunities. That is really first and
foremost what LinkedIn is. It helps you
get found. So, LinkedIn is the primary
sourcing tool for recruiters.
whether they're filling a job now or
building a p pipeline for future roles.
Bless you, Chris. Uh they're searching
by keywords, skills, job titles,
locations,
uh remote, hybrid, on-site, all of that
good stuff. So, if your profile isn't
built out with the right terms,
you're invisible to recruiters,
literally. Um,
and you know it matters because
recruiters are use boolean searches to
find candidates. So as an example, a
boolean search is a title in quotes
capital and
and then what you're looking for. You
need them to have what? I need them to
be located in New York. that's in quotes
followed by another all caps and and
then I need this person to have
JavaScript all in quotes and that's you
know you can build on that as well. A
strong profile with the right keywords,
skills and summary increases your
chances of showing up in search results.
Okay.
Having a clear
keywordrich headline
and skills section ensures
you are part of the conversation even
when you're not applying because
recruiters proactively
source talent on LinkedIn.
This is where your personal branding
starts.
Unlike résumés, LinkedIn allows you to
tell your story.
why you got into tech,
what you care about, and what you're
building.
It's the first impression that often
sticks. So, what what is what is
personal branding?
It is how you intentionally present
yourself, your values, your story, your
skills, and your voice to others in a
professional context.
It's not about being flashy. It's not
about uh, you know, over being overly
polished.
It's about being clear, consistent, and
authentic in how you show up.
Are we is everyone clear?
And are there any questions at the
moment?
Okay.
Why is LinkedIn the perfect place to
start? Well,
unlike a resume which is limited to
bullet points and rigid formatting,
LinkedIn gives you space to explain the
why behind the what. It allows you to
connect the dots between your background
and your career goals, especially for
junior developers or those pivoting from
another field. Okay,
many of you are pivoting from another
field. Many of you had careers and lives
in other working and educational
situations that are absolutely valid and
still um should be mentioned in LinkedIn
even though you're shifting gears. It's
good to know who you are and what you're
about because those skills that you
acquired in those other opportunities,
they matter.
This is where your story lives.
So, your about section isn't a summary
of your resume.
It's a snapshot of who you are, why you
made the leap into tech, what drives
you, and where you're headed. This is
where your voice matters.
And your voice and how you tell your
story is very important to recruiters
because so much of what we do in real
life professional situations, you have
to talk about your work. You interface
with your internal business partners,
perhaps external clients.
So telling your story also gives you
practice in interviewing.
So
here's an example, right? After 5 years
in healthcare administration, I
discovered coding through a free online
course and was immediately hooked. I'm
now building responsive front-end
projects with React and constantly
looking for ways to blend design and
functionality.
Simple. It can be as clear as that or
you can go a little bit deeper and uh
maybe talk and mention your previous
experience and how it led you uh to this
moment in a little bit more detail.
And you know this answers, you know, why
should you care? Why should why why
should anybody care what your LinkedIn
profile says? Well, hiring managers and
recruiters want to feel something when
they visit your profile.
They're not just looking for what you
can do.
They're
looking for a whiff of what motivates
you.
Do you have clarity around your goals?
Are you someone that from a casting
perspective
will be right for a certain group,
maybe the group that you're hiring.
Okay. So, a thoughtful summary helps a
recruiter connect with you on a human
level.
It sets the tone for everything else.
So once you nail your voice and message
in a summary and headline, it helps
guide the tone of a portfolio site if
that's what you're listing. If you're a
front-end person who is excited about
design as well, that
one one moment
I see a note. Will we have a recording
of this meeting? Uh, yes, it is
recording right now. Yes, we are. We're
all set with that. Um, it it it allows
you to set the tone for your portfolio
site, your cover letters, what you post
and share on LinkedIn, and how you
introduce yourself in interviews.
So the personal brand should feel
cohesive across all platforms, across
your website, across your LinkedIn
profile, any other um platform where you
are showcasing who you are.
Any questions
about this employer branding piece?
Okay, Glenn, LinkedIn is to
Yeah. Yes. Yep. Absolutely. Agreed.
Thanks, Glenn.
Um,
so here's a quick activity to sort of
reinforce this. We're not going to go
into breakout rooms. I just, you know,
want you to take five minutes and think
that if someone only saw your LinkedIn
for 30 seconds,
what three things would you want them to
walk away knowing about?
Three simple points.
And those
those points
can become the framework for your
headline and your summary. So, we're
really taking it slow and starting from
the top to the bottom.
Who would like to start
and uh share their three points?
I can't I can't I mean only because we
only did it in
>> um well I think I'd like them to see
that I have industry experience you know
I have I have a background in a lot of
the stuff I'm trying to do that I'm a
constant and personal learner because
I'm pivoting from one kind of
programming language to others and that
I'm a problem solver that that's the
probably the three things that come to
mind right now.
Excellent. Thanks, Glenn.
All right, I'm gonna start I'm going to
start picking peeps.
I'm going to the end where some of you
don't have your screens on and I'm going
to say key,
what you got? Did you do it? Did you
were you able to write anything down?
Are you there?
No.
Sorry, I'm here.
>> Oh, hey. Can hear you now.
>> Um, for me, I don't know if I
necessarily got three of them, but at
least two is that that I'm like creative
>> um and like helpful or like problem
solving.
>> Um, that's kind of the big stuff for me.
>> Yeah. I something I notice um about you
from just speaking with you um very
collaborative
um and you know mentioning uh your
skills
um that is something that we'll get a
little bit deeper into but it doesn't
always have to be based on um hard
skills right it can be based on your
soft skills too because soft skills
matter So, thank you for bringing that
um those up, Key. I really appreciate
it. Um Braden, what about you?
Gonna go down the line.
Are you there?
>> You being shy?
>> Yeah, I'm just being a bit shy at the
moment. Um,
>> I don't want to force you. It's okay.
>> No, no, you're totally okay. I I
apologize. Um, I'm still thinking about
it.
>> Okay. All right. All good. All good.
Yes, Glenn.
>> Real quick, I I heard
>> that putting a lot of soft skills was I
heard the exact opposite of soft skills,
like you know, um, that you don't want
to put be to have the whole lot of soft
skills. Then you're saying kind of the
opposite. I mean, it makes sense what
you're saying. I'm just not sure what
the what the is the school of thought
the soft skills as a you're as a
recruiter. Is that what you're looking
at mostly or?
>> I'm looking at all the skills,
everything. And the reality is is all
positions and all roles in any
organizations
requires hard and soft skills. Sometimes
soft skills can be very very important.
And I I say this quite a bit. You can be
an amazing coder and you can do your job
exceedingly well within the hard skill
framework.
But
if you're a jerk and nobody likes to
work with you,
if you can't present your work
and present to clients and internal
business partners and that's part of the
job. We need to know that inter client
interfacing
collaboration
um
client-f facing skills. You have that.
And you know, if you go into your
LinkedIn profile and you start editing
each
uh area, each place that you've worked,
you'll have the opportunity to add
skills. And there's so many skills for
you to choose from.
I like to add a good amount of skills
because those are the keywords that
applicant tracking systems are picking
up and what recruiters are picking up
when they
when they do these boolean searches or
when they are structuring a search
within LinkedIn. Yes, Melissa, hello.
I just have one question about how you
would word, you know, if you're trying
to cater to like a boolean search. If
you're trying to word it to where like
somebody who loves to work in a team and
is happy to take the lead and be a
leader in a project, but is also equally
happy to follow and let somebody else
take the lead. How would you word that
for a boolean search?
Um, I'd probably
do a like a mixed bag. I'd probably do
quote uh end quote project lead caps and
and then quote um team lead and
quotes
um
collaborative.
Like I throw a bunch of things in there
because as a recruiter I like to start
big and then narrow down. Like I like to
see what a big search is going to give
me and then I'll drill down.
>> Okay.
>> Because it's always the long game when
it comes to recruiting.
>> When you say profile, do you mean the
header section at the very top LinkedIn
profile or you mean throughout the whole
experience and skills?
>> The entire the entire your LinkedIn
profile is the entire page.
>> Oh, okay. Okay. I didn't know if I
should
>> right now. I'm just kind of talking
about headline summary
little bit on experience and skills but
we'll be digging even deeper. This is
going to be an 18week process right. So
um
recruiters
so
visibility your visibility equals
opportunity
right? If you're not visible to
recruiters, it we're not going to be
able to give you the opportunity to be
considered for a role because we can't
see you. We don't know who you are. Um,
so you show up in search results when
recruiters look for skills. And this is
where that it's important to populate
that skills section.
The more complete and optimized
your profile is, the more you'll appear
and you want that as well. That's the
visibility that we're looking at. So,
what does that mean
on LinkedIn? Being seen equals being
considered, right? So the more fully
built, keywordrich and active your
profile is,
the more likely you are to appear in
recruiter searches and be contacted for
jobs um you know that you might not have
even applied for. So that's the thing.
It's almost like LinkedIn is doing the
work for you. Okay.
Um,
recruiters like to use LinkedIn like
Google. That's that LinkedIn is our
database. It's our first initial touch
point and goto. Um, recruiters don't
just browse job boards. They search
LinkedIn using boolean strings and
keywords. Um, you so for say junior
developer uh with a certain
uh program in a certain area. So, we
would go quote junior front-end
developer end quote. Then we'll put and
and we'll put JavaScript and New York.
So, that's just kind of giving you a
little bit of insight into how we
structure our searches and why.
You could add in remote or if someone
need to be located in New York and have
a hybrid work schedule into
uh widen and Kennedy's New York office,
we add New York and then remote in
there. Okay. Um,
so if your profile, if your profile
contains
specific keywords
and it's complete, you'll appear in
search results. If not, you won't. It's
pretty cut and dry. Um, so the most
important sections for search visibility
headline.
So, if you were to look at my profile,
it underneath my name in the headline,
it talks about who I am in a few
keywords. And you can use a few
keywords. It doesn't have doesn't have
to just be, you know, full stack full
stack de developer.
You if you that's all you would like to
focus on and that's your main passion,
that's fine. But people, recruiters want
to know that. Okay, great. They've got
that hard skill, but is there anything
else there that you can add in that
headline?
You have the about, the summary, which
even digs even a little bit deeper and
tells a little bit more of a story and
plays off of that headline.
Then, of course, you have your
experience and within those exper that
experience, you have your skills. Any
questions?
Yeah,
everyone hanging in there? A lot of
people are cameras are off. Okay. Hope
you're I hope everyone's okay. Um,
LinkedIn
actually prioritizes completed portfolio
profiles. Sorry. So they they literally
reward
their the completeness of a profile and
it's known as being an allstar.
So you're more likely to rank higher in
recruiter searches.
um you are more trusted as a credible
candidate and you know it's signaling
that you're active and ready for
opportunities.
What makes a profile
complete and qualifies to be an all-star
professional photo. Melissa right there.
Right there. Nice professional photo.
a robust headline,
a clear and concise summary about you
that adds your flare.
Okay?
And having at least two work experiences
listed in your LinkedIn profile,
right?
And even if you know your previous
occupation was not
within uh development or design or
anything similar. That's okay.
Yes, Alyssa.
Um, so you meant like you literally
answered the question I was about to
ask, but but the things that you
described were like I'm thinking like
it's like a complete like like it's like
you checked off all the bo you filled in
all the form like you filled in all the
fields kind of completeness like how do
they know that my pro my picture is not
professional? How do they know that my
headline is not robust or whatever? Like
how do they you know like
>> well you can see it.
>> Yeah you can see it like there are some
you can see it visually see it when you
go to someone who decide those people
who decide if the profile is complete.
>> Um
well no I mean LinkedIn LinkedIn sees if
it's complete because it gives you that
all star. So, if all of the boxes are
checked, right? If you've got your
professional photo, you've got your
headline, you've got your summary, you
have gone into find your current and
previous company that you're working
with and you uh you build that
experience profile
based on what they are giving you when
you do the drop down, right? Um, and
then all of those skills filled out. And
then of course, don't forget
>> adding your education, which PS, by the
way, don't don't put your years. You
don't need to put that. Don't put your
years on your resume either.
So, we'll we'll go over that even a
little bit deeper, right? And also
making sure that you have your
recommendations
from previous employer employers that
you have worked for managers uh seuite
individuals people who have worked under
you perhaps that you've mentored all of
that qualifies right so you know and and
all of this activity
boosts your reach so it's not just about
even filling out the profile profile
that boosts your reach. Like say you've
got a perfect profile, you're an
allstar, but it's also about being
active. Comment on posts by others in
tech. And if you don't know others in
tech outside of this group, that's what
you need to be doing because that's
going to help get you job. It's about
networking. And that's another thing
we're going to talk about because here's
the thing and don't forget
Alyssa M Alyssa and Melissa we're going
to do a tongue it's I'm going to get
tongue tied. So let's let's manifest
something here. Melissa's going to come
back from Spain. She's applying jobs.
She's killing it even while on vacation.
She's going to get a amazing
remote full stack developer position
when she gets back. She's going to
interview. She's going to have a great
experience. She's going to get the
salary of her dreams. She's even going
to have the opportunity to work with a
company, and most companies do this, so
make a note, that has a robust employee
referral bonus.
If I mean Melissa's gonna say, "You know
what? That's a great opportunity for me
to make some extra cash." And a lot of
companies anywhere from I've seen $200
to $10,000
referral bonus. Yeah. But my point is,
where is she going to go?
If she hears there are other That's
right. she hears there are other
positions open, she's going to say,
"Dang, you know, I I those really
amazing people." And you know, Alyssa
and I, we had a really good rapport and
we worked really well together. And you
know what? I think casting wise too for
this position, she's going to be great
for this role. And you know, Glenn and
and Key, you know, we've got some other
roles. I'm you know what? I'm going to
submit that their names and their GitHub
profiles and their LinkedIn profile
because not only if they're hired am I
going to get some crazy cash, but I'm
also going to be able to refer them
because I enjoyed working with them and
they work they were at the same academy
as myself. People hire others.
Um yeah, exactly, Melissa. Yeah,
exactly. Exactly.
This is what it's about. The next job
that you get
and and forever more in this industry,
I'm telling you, so much of it is
through your relationships and your
networking and who you meet and who
you've worked with in the past.
Yeah, the referral bonus. I know they're
great. Recruiters don't get the referral
bonus, so Oh well. Um, so you know,
comment on posts, react to alumni or
recruiter updates, share progress on
your latest boot camp project or you
know what you've been doing in this
academy. And you can do it on LinkedIn,
too. Because you know what else?
The more you all talk about what you're
doing in this academy and how you're
succeeding, you're putting it out there
for other people to contact you and say,
"Oh, you know what? I want to be a
coder, too. Do you recommend this?" And
then you're meeting other people. And
that person might even be like, "Oh, we
have an open position at my company."
So, it's really to your benefit. Post
once a month with a career or learning
update. This increases your visibility
in your network feed and the recruiters
are watching. You know, it's like, I
didn't even apply for this role, but a
recruiter found me on LinkedIn. That's
the goal. That's what LinkedIn is for.
Most people are like, I don't even know
what LinkedIn does. I apply and nobody
re, you know, reaches back out to me.
Sure,
it's the name of the game in a lot of
places. But are any of you even looking
at who's viewing your profile?
Do you know how to do that?
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. You pay for it, right? It's not
free.
>> No. No. You can you can see it even if
you're not paying for premium or
recruiter light. Okay. All right. So,
your presence signals that you're
serious about your transition into tech,
that you're actively learning and
growing, and that you're someone worth
watching. So, even if you're not
applying to jobs yet, visibility builds
trust and recognition before you need
it. Does that make sense?
Okay, any questions? Am I going too
fast?
Okay, now we're going to do a little a
little uh I'm going to give you guys a
little bit of homework, but not yet, but
I'm just giving you that quick. There's
going to be a little homework and it's
going to help you with your LinkedIn.
So, network effects are powerful.
Connections matter. 70 to 85% of roles
are th are filled through networking.
LinkedIn gives you a built-in
professional community and job search
tool. Engaging equals staying top of
mind for opportunities that recruiters
are sourcing for. And again, yes, you
want that opportunity now. You want to
work now. But
I pipeline talent all the time. And
sometimes I'll even reach out to a
candidate and say, "You know what? I saw
your profile. You look really
interesting. I don't have a position
open for you right this second, but I
really want to connect with you. Maybe
we have an informational interview
and you know, we'll see where we are
after the call.
I will even cold email hiring managers
and say, "Hey, I just met Keith, this
this this amazing developer key today. I
really think that you should take a look
at her work and just look at the bio
that I I've written for her that, you
know, kind of went over the touch points
of our call. Sometimes hiring leads are
like, you know what, I want to meet her.
She looks cool. They meet and then
they'll say, "Thank you for the
introduction. You know what? She is so
good. I'm going to work with finance to
see if we can create a role for her."
I've seen it happen a million times.
So many roles are never even posted
public. They're shared through internal
referrals or recommendations. Even when
applying online, a referral gives you
four times higher chances of getting
noticed. So you don't need a massive
network. You need a warmed tone
and and you know you LinkedIn is a
builtin professional network
and um you know you it lets you
reconnect with people from your past,
engage with uh fellow developers,
mentors, instructors
and and visibility builds trust over
time. So,
you know, you stay on top of mind, you
show up, uh that you show that you're
active, you build a reputa reputation
over time, and and network isn't one big
ask. It's a lot of small touch points.
You know, you're encouraging students or
or or you're in I'm encouraging you to
take the pressure off of yourselves.
Networking isn't one grand gesture. It's
a habit and it's something I do all day
every day on LinkedIn. I'm constantly
connecting with people, reaching out to
people,
looking at profiles that like, oh,
that's so interesting, and then talking
to people about their work, what makes
them tick, what they're inspired by,
what they're looking for, how you can
help someone
land a position that not only changes
their immediate life, but also the
direction of their future and, you know,
helps their family.
It's this amazing trickle down. Um, and
it makes you feel so good. So,
your network is your job search engine.
Your LinkedIn profile grows with you.
It's never done. It's constantly
evolving
and and it evolves as you grow. It shows
your progression through your
professional life and and share what
you're learning and stay active.
Sound good?
I would like to
open
up to any questions that you might have.
Anyone? Anyone?
No.
Okay. So, I let me in the chat.
I'm going to give you some homework.
Okay.
All right. So, me put this in the chat
and I'll also read it off as well.
[Music]
Okay.
All right.
So,
here's what I'm looking for.
Choose two to three roles that you want.
full stack developer, junior front-end
developer,
QA,
BA,
right?
And then search for those roles on
LinkedIn.
Read three job descriptions
and highlight those repeated keywords.
And now look at your profile.
Are those keywords there?
Let me see if I can share my screen
because I am pulling up
my LinkedIn profile so I can show you
what I mean.
Can everyone see my screen?
Yeah. Okay.
So, I keep it simple.
headsh shot that I've had my
full name
and
everything that you've got here. So, let
me pull
my notes.
Okay.
So take a look
and you know there you can see that
there's you know my my personal branding
it all exists there
what I'm open what kind of work I'm open
to
got techjoy software year and where I
graduated.
Now, here's my about.
And then based on
what I noted as my skills in every place
that I've worked,
it will populate some of that up here as
my top skills.
And there's a lot,
right?
Sorry, my computer's a little slow.
Creative pro collaborative problem
solving,
strategic sourcing.
I have deep experience in hiring foreign
nationals,
so I put visas.
career development.
There's even more than that in some of
these sections.
My activity when I am hiring at times if
it's for something I need fast. If I'm
working a freelance job, I'll create a
post. But I am constantly reposting
positions that other
recruiters are working on. And if I know
that I have the talent
uh in my profile to to share I'll I'll
share the and and repost.
And you've got my experience.
Techjo joy software.
This is you know how you know oh they
are really working there.
I put in for the most part where I've
consulted but also
um where I've worked full-time
and I do not and go over this and we
will go over this a little bit deeper. I
don't I don't put the duties.
I I used to
um but that's a little antiquated for
2025 listing. Oh, this is what I did at
this job. It's redundant, especially if
you're noting your skills. And you want
to note the skills because that's what's
going to pull you into those key
searches that recruiters are doing. It's
not going to pull from everything that
you've written within your LinkedIn
profile. It's going to pick what
LinkedIn gives you the option to select.
Does that make sense?
Okay.
I've been around
now. That's my experience.
Okay. And here is my education.
I do not list the years.
I have a couple of licenses and
certifications that I've listed.
And now
recommendations.
I
make it a point to get recommendations
from everywhere that I've worked.
So, and these are hiring managers that
I've hired for.
So, pulling from every relationship
possible.
Taking a minute. I'm sorry. Hiring
leads.
I hired Angelica.
I hired Daniel. I hired Victoria.
worked very closely with Kathleen Nanda
over at IPG Health.
Other people I've worked with,
another recruiter
that was my colleague,
another recruiter who's phenomenal. And
by the way, everyone who
you
get excited about and who maybe you
follow and you reach out to and maybe
working at companies that you want to
work with right here. This is how this
is this is how you find your next
connection. Go through people's profiles
that you would that you admire. Scroll
all the way down to their
recommendations
and then just reach out. Maybe they're
working at companies that excite you.
I've got recommendations gosh all the
way back to wh
stop sharing.
Does is was this helpful everyone?
I know I was talking a lot and I don't
want to
only
be be you know blabbing but
and what is the difference between hard
and soft skills? Hard skills are the
program and database knowledge that you
know
right? being able to um
uh utilize technology, Slack, things of
that nature. Those are the hard skills.
the soft skills. Um, being
collaborative, being client facing,
being
a nice person,
soft skill,
not being being uh able to be cool,
calm, and collected under pressure. Soft
skill very important.
All right.
Uh I don't know if if uh LinkedIn
interpreting the skill section is is
similar to YouTube tags. Maybe I don't
know.
Um
yes key I would I would suggest removing
the blurbs responsibilities and what you
did in your experience. Um because the
whole idea is to then replace that with
the skills.
The skills are what's important.
>> Got a couple more minutes.
>> So you're So you're not putting there in
there what you did at a particular job,
just the skills that you use. So does it
ever come into play at all that what you
did at the certain jobs or is that just
is that just for your resume?
Um that is for your resume and it is for
you to discuss when you are in the inter
interview process
because you know you're not only in in
today's job market you're not only
applying through LinkedIn
you're sending your resume
you're also and I encourage you
to start doing cover letters cover
letters are back and that is because the
job market is very saturated
and there are a lot of people that are
looking for work and you really have to
stand out in this job market. Would I
have done a cover letter in 2020 or
2021? Probably not. Precoid probably
not.
Now I would.
I did the same. I I recommended the same
back in 2008 when the economy was taking
a little bit of a hit and there were a
lot of people out of work then you know
to stand out when when the market is
saturated that's when you know you have
to stand out just whatever you do do not
put your photograph on your resume
don't do that
for for goodness sake don't do it
that is that's you know an Asian
European thing. It's It's not what we do
here.
I always give people that are not US
nationals
um a free pass
when I get a resume with their
photograph. And I mean, hey, if you want
to be I think that, you know,
representing yourself in terms of like
because someone asked about I think the
the the photograph. I mean, maybe not
post a picture of you and your cat.
I think it also depends on what kind of
role you're looking for. If you are a
comedic writer, yeah, that's acceptable
as far as I'm concerned.
I mean, I love I love animals. So, I
will tend to give people a free pass
with their animals in the photo, but
in in long run, probably not.
So
really thinking about your target
companies,
what's what are what are your top five
dream dream companies?
And you know what I would do?
I would and what I do do in LinkedIn in
the search and I can even let me share
again. Let's do this in real time.
Okay. So,
somebody throw out the name of a company
that they really, really want to work
at.
>> Come on, guys. You don't have your dream
companies that you want to that you
daydream about working at?
>> The um Space Telescope Science Institute
in Baltimore.
>> Oh, okay. Okay. Well, Alyssa,
>> I'm not sure if this
>> Space Telescope Science Institute,
I think, is what it's called. Or
>> Boom.
All right. Mental note. Okay. I guess I
guess I got to put that on the list for
you, Alyssa. All right. So, look what
we've got.
>> And Baltimore is great. They've got
amazing food as well.
So, I'm gonna follow them.
>> Baltimore is amazing for food. Um, okay.
So, now I'm following. And you want to
start and do that, too, because then it
updates and things come to your feed.
And then what I do is I'll hit 21
followers. No. Is it followers that I
want to do? No. I'm sorry. Rewind.
Darn. All right. So, I'm going to do
that. Don't want to do that. So, I'll
click on the company. And then I go to
501
to 1,000 employees. And I'm going to
click that.
Oh, look.
Look at all these people.
Astronomer and software engineer. How am
I connected to this woman? I love this.
But now you go through senior software
engineer. Yeah. Okay. Cuz you know what?
Connecting with that person.
That's not what I wanted, but I'll
connect with him anyway.
Where's the other guy?
But I'll just I and yes, LinkedIn will
kind of slap your wrist and say
you're asking to connect to too many
people that you don't know.
I'm a recruiter. I don't need to know
them. I just need to hire them. I'm
going to send without a note. I connect
with people and send without a note when
I'm really just wanting to like connect
with people because once I connect with
people, I'll be able to snoop around and
find their email address. I'm a very
good stalker. That is what recruiters do
very, very well.
But you can scroll through here
and you know, oh, driven coordinator.
Okay, we're getting close. Human
resources. Uh, okay. Let's see if we can
find something that says recruiter or
uh talent acquisition. Now, this could
be a somewhere that the HR people do the
recruiting.
That oftenimes happens, especially when
it says generalist
because what a generalist is is someone
that has a focus of human resources, but
you know, they're probably dabbling in
finance resources,
talent acquisition, right? So, you just
go through and yeah, it's tedious
because you're looking at 78 pages, but
you're looking at h who do I want to
connect with?
Senior HR generalist. I'm going to guess
that that's their that's their vibe
that the human resources folks are also
doing the recruiting.
Does all of this make sense? Look guys,
junior software developer, Booya Shaka.
>> Yeah, I think they're paid through NASA,
so they might not actually be hiring,
forunately.
>> But you want to find out if they're
hiring? Let's see. Oh.
Oh, look, Alyssa.
>> Oh, it says actively hiring.
>> Actively hiring. Prove it,
>> girl.
Any job title.
And look, they've got locations, so you
can look like listen.
And what I would probably do
is All right, let's go back. Let's go
back to
Oh, this is annoying. Okay,
let me do it here.
See, I can search in recruiter, but I
that's I don't want to lay all that
recruitery recruitery stuff on you.
So, I want to go back to the company
because then come on, guys.
Let's do this. Make it easy.
I'm sorry y'all. My
around this time my laptop just gets
like I don't want to do any more work
and I know we're two minutes over time
but I just want to Okay, videos. Oh,
jobs. So, if you go to the company's
main page, you'll for the most part
they'll they might show
Oh, look.
>> Oh, senior full stack.
associate analyst.
>> Now, what I would do too,
um, I'd probably do a little bit of
cutting, copying and pasting.
Let's see. And then you just like, what
kind of work are they doing? Right.
All right.
>> They're building a telescope right now.
Shoot it off into space.
They also
>> So now you can start looking for jobs
and
>> now you can see some of the cool things
they've done their press releases
menu. This is probably where you
>> Yeah, they had a director role what we
do
>> listed a while back that I was about to
apply for. This was like a couple months
ago and then I realized, oh wait, this
is like the level of people with PhD
stuff like
Yeah, how to apply. Sometimes you go to
uh these sections
and you know it tells you create a
profile, returning applicants like it
gives you sort of the rundown
and
but look careers
like guys you can create a beautiful
email introduction about yourself.
package that all up. Talk about how
passionate you are
and
you know you just don't know what's
possible.
So what have I missed? There are a lot
of comments. I presume that the listed
skills are searchable. Yes. And
therefore significant. Yes.
Um automatic. How about intel? Oh,
Glenn, I'm sorry. I didn't. But yeah, do
it. Run the search. Tell us what you
got. Would you recommend having a
dedicated email for a job employment for
your You know what? Sure.
if if that's what you want to do, just
make sure it's not like,
and I'm not even kidding, like
some of the emails that
professional individuals have given me,
I'm like, I I can't give this to a
hiring lead. Like, I can't even say it
in in
>> Yahoo
or
>> Yeah. I I can't. It's It's It was just
foul. I'm like, "Oh my god." And this
guy was like the SVP of data engineering
at McKenzie.
Like, oh my goodness. Okay. He was a
techno DJ in a past life, so you know,
he had a wild uh email handle. But um if
you all have any questions, I am on
Discord. My main days are Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday. I'll be about here
and there on Thursday, not Friday.

to reach out, ask a question.
