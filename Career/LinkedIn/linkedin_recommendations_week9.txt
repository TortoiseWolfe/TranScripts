LinkedIn Recommendations: How to Ask For and Write Strong Recommendations (Week 9)
https://youtu.be/vXjuYguGB7s

Hey Leo, how are you?
>> Hey there. Doing good.
>> Cool. I'm just going to give a little
bit more time for people to to join. So
stay tuned.
Okay, Leo, I guess it is just you and me
today. You've got a
personal session.
>> Oh, boy.
So today is a pretty cool um
a uh pretty cool session um because
we're going to be talking about
recommendations on LinkedIn. So
basically how to ask for and write
strong recommendations.
Um I think that we've talked about this
before. Are you familiar with the
recommendation section on LinkedIn?
Uh, fair enough. Not really.
>> Oh, no, no problem. Here, let's take a
look. Um, let me pull up actually one.
I'll show you my recommendations. And it
doesn't have to be like mine. So, I've
been doing I've been asking for
recommendations for a long time. So, I
have a bunch. Um, so don't feel like,
oh,
I have to have as many as her. Not at
all.
Less is more. as I keep on saying. All
right,
let me go to my profile and I will
share my screen so you can take a look.
Okay,
can you see my screen?
Yep, I can.
>> Okay. And it's my LinkedIn profile.
Yeah.
>> Oh, I guess it's on the profile.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah.
>> Okay, cool.
>> I see it.
>> Oh, somebody has popped in. Hold on. I
don't know who it is.
>> Hold on. I've got to go back to admit
someone.
Where? Oh, key.
All right.
Hi, Key.
All right. So,
here is my LinkedIn profile. So, if you
scroll down all the way down,
you can see
recommendations.
Now, the recommendations are typically
split in two. recommendations that
you've received
and recommendations that you've given.
And I've given 20.
I have received
43
and I won't go through them and read
them all, but
>> I'm guessing I haven't done this at all.
It's not my profile.
Not a worry. Not a worry at all. You
know what, Leo? Let's go to your
LinkedIn profile really quickly. There
you are.
Just to kind of because I'd like to have
a look there.
All right.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Screen does not want to scroll for some
reason. Here we go.
Okay.
licenses. Okay. You've got your
experience. Okay. Skills. All right.
Yeah. Probably doesn't pop up because
you,
>> you know, need to ask and or receive,
but it's definitely something that you
and Key can start doing with your fellow
students, right? Like if you worked and
partnered with a couple with a whether
it's let's just say you partnered with
each other on a particular project you
can write a recommendation for each
other and I will go through this a
little bit deeper and now I see that
people are starting to join
so that's good I will stop sharing my
screen
and I will continue. Yes, Key, you have
your hand raised.
>> Yeah, I was just going to say as far as
like recommendations, if you work on
like the challenge weeks or anything and
we're part of those groups, like reach
everybody afterwards and be like, "Hey,
I'm working on my LinkedIn profile." If
you like could,
>> you know, take the time to make a quick
recommendation
>> and then even like put it on LinkedIn
because you can request them via
LinkedIn as well.
>> Oh, yeah. That's exactly what I'm
talking about.
>> But yeah, but you can reach out in like
the Discord for like people who are here
in Joy of Coding and do it like a double
reach out, right?
>> Once in Discord and then once in
LinkedIn as like a little potential
reminder.
>> Yeah, 100%. I mean, I feel like all of
you should be doing it with each other.
And then of course you know people who
have guided you and led like your
mentors people like Alyssa and Katrina
Dr. Emily you know when when she's able
and she has time to be able to write a
short quick recommendation for you. I
mean it's definitely something that I am
going to be doing myself.
um asking folks to provide any kind of
quick recommendation for me as a coach.
So, you know, it really doesn't matter.
So, since Hope and Key kind of joined
and I started with Leo and we kind of
just started diving in. Let's just start
from the top and um we are talking about
recommendations on LinkedIn and how to
ask for and write strong
recommendations,
you know, and we'll we'll also do a
little bit of a live practice as well
and it'll be nice since we're, you know,
a bit of a of a smaller group. Um so
um we
have built a lot so far when it comes to
LinkedIn right so far we've done eight
weeks um week one was why LinkedIn
matters
understanding what LinkedIn and as a job
search tool we've talked about profile
basics crafting a compelling summary
highlighting skills, projects, and
education,
custom URL settings,
building your network. That we did a
part one and a part two because that
takes quite a bit of time and um
thoughtfulness, right? And then week
seven was part two. So, keeping
relationships warm, authenticity, and
that that was the part two of
networking.
Last week we discussed messaging and
cold reachout. So, to alumni, to
recruiters, to hiring leads.
This week we are, you know, we're
transitioning into week nine. And now
that your profile is starting to take
shape and your network is warming up,
let's layer on credibility.
Okay, recommendations are proof and they
are personal references that live on
your profile and it's a very nice way
for people to get a feel for how you are
in real time on the job, how you
perform, what is your credibility.
So today we'll learn how to ask for
recommendations on LinkedIn, how to
write them, and even practicing both.
Okay, so
I see key there a couple of chats here.
Um
I am eating a moment, but I turn on
camera as soon as I'm done. Okay, you
want an example? Oh, great. Thank you,
Key. That's great. He's got some Reco uh
examples too, which is great. Um and
definitely, you know, as you are, this
is also an idea that I just had.
While you are
searching for folks to build your
network,
take a look at their recommendations.
See if they have them. See if they've
listed them. And you know what you can
do? I'll recommend you if you recommend
me. It's kind of like a give and take,
right? So
why, you know, we we already did a
little bit of an intro about this,
right? So why do recommendations matter?
It builds credibility, validation, and
trust. It is also how recruiters and
hiring managers you know we are we're
going to see how
both use them as well as the type of
recommendations
peer manager mentor client.
Okay.
Why do they matter?
So recommendations act as social proof
on LinkedIn. validate what you've said
about yourself in your summary and
experience sections.
They are like, "Yes, I've worked with
this person. I hired this person. This
is why I would hire them or consider
them for future roles again."
Um, they demonstrate credibility. So,
someone else vouches for your skills,
character, and impact.
They build trust. So recruiters and
hiring managers see not only what you've
done but also how others experienced
working and partnering with you.
Um think of recommendations as many
references that live publicly on your
profile.
So how do recruiters and hiring managers
use them?
Hiring managers often scan
recommendations before or after an
interview to confirm impressions.
Um, recruiters may use them as tie
breakers
between candidates
um, you know, e in equally strong
candidates, but let's check their
recommendations on LinkedIn as well as
their references.
That often happens happens they add
weight to keywords on your profile. So
for an example if someone writes she led
the React project brilliantly that
reinforces your technical experience.
Okay. So they they're especially
valuable for career changers
or students with limited formal
experience.
Let's say that one again because that
those two things is the demographic of
TechJoy Academy, right?
Recommendations on LinkedIn are
especially valuable for career changers
and students with limited formal work
experience. Recommendations highlight
transferable skills and professionalism.
So a lot of folks in TechJoy are career
changers. They are also students who
have never thought about coding or have
coded in the past.
So
these mini
projects or these workshops and these
things that you're working on with live
clients,
these are critical for asking for
recommendations for those that you
partnered with specifically on these
projects who have oversaw
or project managed these projects. And
then maybe your mentors who have built
you up a little bit, given you
confidence
uh and and helped you through the
project or they or you have helped
others. This really is a great way and
and there are different types of
recommendations
and I encourage all of you to think
broadly. Okay. So peer recommendations,
classmates, teammates, colleagues who
can speak to collaboration, those who
have worked with you, managers,
supervisor recommendations,
people who can show accountability,
leadership, or quality of work. I've
already mentioned this but mentors
coach recommendations
highlights you know people who can
highlight growth learning character
and you know I don't know
answer me this all of you when you're
working on these projects at techjoy
do do students have the opportunity to
be client-f facing
Hope you're shaking your head.
>> No. Um, we No, I take that back on this
one I'm working on. Actually, I have
watched a loom
from the client. So, I know who he is,
>> but I haven't spoken to him directly,
though. I've left notes or created work
that he looked at and said, "Oh, yes,
this is what I want."
>> Okay. Okay. you know we don't talk only
only Dr. Emily and Alyssa are working,
you know, talk to the client.
>> The client. Okay. Very good. Very good.
Thank you for clarifying that. Now,
sometimes, you know, with client
recommendations. So, this is valuable
for oftentimes for freelancers or
projectbased
contributors.
And you know it demonstrates when you
have a client recommendation it
demonstrates reliability and outcomes.
So I would say if any of you
end up having more facetime and more
interactions with a client
before asking a client for their
recommendation. I would maybe go to Dr.
Emily and Alyssa and and see if that
would be appropriate first. But then of
course if you have your own clients that
you're working with or you um are
working a position even if it's a
part-time
uh what have you um it can also be
valuable to have those folks uh provide
you with recommendations.
So, what I'd like you to do and keep in
the back of your mind as we go through
this session is think of one person from
each of these categories
who could realistically vouch for you
and write down three to four names.
Okay?
So, think about that and maybe, you
know, while I'm speaking, jot some of
those names down that might come to
mind. Some of what I say may prompt an
idea in your head of someone you might
want to ask for a recommendation.
So,
how to ask for a recommendation.
Now, who to ask? We've gone through this
a little bit, but I will keep repeating
this. Former colleagues, managers,
clients, classmates.
Okay.
So, when do you ask for recommendations?
The best time is after a project, after
an internship,
after
you collaborating on something.
You want to make sure that you are fresh
in the mind of someone in order to ask
for a recommendation
and they can then ask you to recommend
them through LinkedIn. So be aware of
that.
Now some examples, former managers or
leads from projects, right? Maybe
Alyssa, you know, Key, Leo, Hope. If the
three of you worked on a project
together, maybe you are recommending
each other. Totally acceptable and
you know something that you can do. Um,
classmates on team coding projects,
instructors,
mentors who can speak to your learning
progress.
That is also something I'd like you to
think about because
being in a boot camp like this is a
perfect opportunity again to dip back
into the last couple of weeks.
Perfect storm storm for networking,
right? as well as um
uh
it's perfect for
being able to tap each other for
networking job opportunities and now
adding in recommendations.
Any questions or thoughts so far?
Okay, so like I had mentioned with
timing, best times to ask is right after
completing a project or an assignment,
after receiving positive feedback from
someone, right?
When wrapping up an internship, a boot
camp, or a position.
Now, why does timing matter?
People's memory is fresh and they're
more inclined to write something
meaningful.
Uh how how do you do this?
LinkedIn uh has a built-in tool. You can
directly request a recommendation,
but the default message is impersonal.
So crafting some something of meaning is
recommended even though LinkedIn and its
AI will try to produce something for you
to to send. Get creative with it.
Personalize your message, right? Reach
out first with a note before sending a
LinkedIn request. So don't just send a
LinkedIn request and hope that somebody
sees it because they might not. that's
also a possibility. But to also just
give them a heads up saying, "Hey, I'm
going to be asking for a recommendation.
I had such a great time and I learned so
much being mentored uh by you as well
as, you know, your partnership on this
project at Tetjoy. So, let's definitely
um maybe do some recommendations for
each other. Does that make sense?"
Cool.
Now,
uh you can also
do a hybrid approach, right? So, first
send a warm DM or email and then follow
up with the LinkedIn tool uh for ease.
So, that's also a good way to do it. um
framing your ask.
Keep it clear,
appreciative,
non-demanding.
Make it easy for them to say yes by
suggesting what they might focus on. You
can do that as well. So, for example,
um
hi key.
I uh I valued working with you on
this TechJoy project. I'm working on
strengthening my LinkedIn presence and
would love if you'd feel comfortable
writing a short recommendation.
It would be especially helpful if you
could highlight
skill, quality, project impact.
Thank you so much for considering.
Right. So key things to avoid,
don't apply pressure. You know, I need
this for my job search. Don't leave it
vague, right? Can you just write me one?
No. And don't mass send the same generic
request that you don't want to do the
old copy and paste. So create something
meaningful.
So,
what I would love the three of you to
do, since hopefully you've been thinking
about names, those three to four names
of of people that you think you might
want to reach out to, let's do a quick
little exercise.
draft
uh a personalized three to four sentence
ask
message uh to anyone on your list and we
will either you know we'll share in the
chat. So once you have finished your
draft copy and paste it in the chat and
we'll talk about it a little bit.
Doesn't have to be perfect.
doesn't have to be anything. Just, you
know, jot something down and and we'll
we'll talk about it and we'll craft a
little bit more.
I'll give all of you uh like five
minutes to do that.
Only about three minutes, but do you
guys need more time?
Yeah. Okay. Hope go. You go right ahead.
Are we are we ready to start?
Yeah. All right. I'm going to get
started with key. So, he gave a nice um
you know, example here. Um and it it
really is, you know, very short and
sweet. Um, hey Rodrigo, I really enjoyed
getting to work with you on the
Consemble.
Hello Katrina.
Um on the Consemble project. I am
working on growing my LinkedIn profile
and would really appreciate a
recommendation from you talking about my
problem solving or team support
contributions.
Thank you so much for taking the time to
do this. Hey Katrina.
So, this is perfect, short and sweet and
to the point and perfect for requesting
uh a review or a recommendation from a
collaborative partner within uh Joy of
Coding.
And you do it would be exactly the same
key
if say you wanted to request from
Katrina say if she would be um willing
to write a recommendation on LinkedIn
for you. And I mentioned Katrina because
she just showed up but because she has a
more of I would say a leadership or
support role within Joy of Coding. So,
she would definitely be someone that
sure you could have partnered with her
on a project, however, would likely be
from a different angle, more one of
mentorship or a lead. So,
it it really is the same with anyone.
It's just sort of how you articulate it.
Leo, did you come up with anything?
Do you have an example?
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Working and learning from you at TechJoy
has been very enjoy. Yeah.
Right now, I'm working on improving my
LinkedIn profile and would really
appreciate a recommendation from you
about me learning from you. Thank you
for lending a hand. Yeah. Yeah. And you
know what? Don't be afraid to throw
these bad boys in AI. If you know you
want a shell and you throw it in AI and
you want to give it a little bit more,
you can throw it in there. Claude,
Gemini, Chachi PT.
Again, like Dr. Emily always says, AI is
here to help you. AI is here to partner
with you, right? So, you can do that.
Great, Leo. Thank you very much for
sharing. I appreciate it.
Hope
my dear, what you got? I'd love to hear.
She's still You're still writing it
down.
Yeah. But just tell us what you've got
so far.
>> Okay. Um, well,
this is what I wrote real quick. I'll
just put it in my um I'll put it in the
chat.
>> Okay, cool.
copy and go over here.
>> Oh, okay. Hi, Alyssa. I really enjoyed
working with you
uh on the inclusive IQ project.
Uh, it was gratifying creating Pixar
Disney style character from a hey genen
AI avatar. I really would appreciate a a
recommendation from you. Yeah. And you
can work on this, tweak it, but you get
the idea, right?
>> This is definitely a very important part
of your LinkedIn profile. again building
that storefront which is a part of your
package. Right? I talk about this so
much. Um now
how
now now we get in a little bit about how
to write a recommendation.
So it's not just about
asking, it's about reciprocating, right?
So key, you might ask Leo for a
recommendation.
Leo can then say, "Cool. Yeah, I'll
definitely get this for you. Will you
write one for me?" Right? Keep it
concise. Three to five sentences.
Now,
if you look at my recommendations,
some of the folks that I have
um that I have on my recommendations
have written
a very lengthy lengthy recommendations.
It's very nice. I don't recommend it,
but it is also very nice. Yes. Um,
first structure,
context, how you know the person, that's
important, the skills and qual qualities
that were generated, the impact they
made, and then your endorsement or your
closing statement.
Tone should be authentic, specific, and
professional. I So, oh, Katrina, I wrote
one for John S. because he had written
one for me and it reminded me that I
hadn't written one for him yet. Yeah.
Right. Sometimes you go through your
recommendations and what you've received
and you're just like, "Oh, I have to I
have to send out some rechos." Right?
Um, so why do strong recommendations
matter? a weak recommendation.
She was nice to work with, a hard
worker,
little vague. And there's no proof of
skills.
A strong recommendation. I collaborated
with Hope on a full stack project where
she led the React development. Her
ability to debug complex UI issues
saved us time and kept our launch on
schedule.
She communicates clearly, contributes
ideas, and is the type of teammate every
team wants.
specificity,
contextual,
and persuasive.
Nice and clean.
Yeah.
Yes.
I will review your recommendations,
Katrina,
>> 100%.
>> Um, so what is the structure of a strong
recommendation? Again, we're using
this as part as the fourpart framework.
And what I'm going to do,
let me copy and paste this into the
chat. So, if you all want to copy and
paste this as reference,
you can
and we can read this all together. So
context
how you know them.
I worked alongside Katrina in the joy of
coding program where we collaborated on
building a Python-based inventory
system.
Okay. Now, skills and quant qualities
that were demonstrated
um uh hope consistently showed strong
problemolving skills and an eagerness to
support teammates by explaining complex
logic clearly.
The impact they made
Leo's contributions improved our app's
efficiency and helped the team stay
motivated during crunch times.
And the closing statement, I would
highly recommend Key for any software
development role. She's reliable,
collaborative, and technically sharp.
The tone is important. Authentic,
specific,
professional, right? So when you're
authentic, you're writing in your
natural voice. So avoid stiff corporate
jargon. Be yourself. That's that's
that's okay. They want to they want to
feel your joy for this person that
you're recommending.
mention a project, a specific project,
task or skill. Optimized our database
clearly
uh versus good with tech,
right?
And then professional, keep it
respectful. No jokes, no casual
nicknames, no inside jokes.
Um,
now
I am going to quickly
go to
my recommendations just just to kind of
give you an idea of what some people
wrote
and then we can
Okay.
And then we will be able to
pop around and maybe look at
um maybe some of keys or Katrina's
and everyone see my screen.
Okay, so
I've got a bunch of recommendations
here.
Um, I have not asked for recommendations
since
uh leaving my position in 2024 at IPG
Health. Um, but here are some of the
things people have said about me, right?
And you can see now my uh good buddy
Thomas who I hired for he was a hiring
lead uh at IPG Health. I love working
with Chelsea for so many reasons. She
finds the best talent. Our creative
department requires very specialized
skill sets, many of which come from
outside pharma. Not a problem for
Chelsea. She sent oodles of outstanding
candidates our way. Her energy could
power a metropolis. There is no slowdown
with Chelsea. She moves with urgency and
exuberance. Pretty sure she runs on
fusion. Very funny. Um, and she
anticipates what you need before you
know you need it. It's borderline
sorcery.
So,
very nice. Thank you. And I won't go
through all of them, but that was a
hiring lead, as was uh Carrie.
Now, Angelica is someone that I actually
hired. So, she is a candidate that I
identified and hired at IPG Health. When
it comes to finding talent, she invests
extra effort into fostering genuine
connections with pro prospective
candidates and making them feel heard.
Um I do try to do that. So she says, "I
highly recommend Chel Chelsea." Um she
talked about um
how I
have been a part of leading uh
integrative programming
uh creating warm human approach to TA
and oftentimes that's really hard to do.
um another hiring manager that I worked
for. This I think is the perfect type of
recommendation because it was short and
sweet. Um
Victoria was special. Um this was a
tough one. Um so she had a lot to say
which was really sweet of her. Kathleen
Nanda, chief talent officer who I hired
for. So you can really see a lot of
folks
um that I hired or I hired for. So the
majority of these folks are hiring
managers. This is someone that I worked
with another recruiter
somewhere in here.
We will see if a familiar face.
Nando.
Um, Nanda and I worked together and then
I hired him. So, yeah. So, you can
continue to review the uh the the folks
that I have here. Um all of them are
amazing people but it should give you a
good idea on
and just again another recommendation
that I can't I can't impress upon you
enough the folks that
because you know what it goes both ways
right
I mentioned that recruiters and hiring
managers look at these recommendations
sometimes times to decide which
candidate to go with
goes both ways.
It goes both ways. What if you have two
offers from two different companies
and you're looking at recommendations?
You should you absolutely should look at
recommendations of those that you are
wanting to connect with and network
with.
and those that you're interviewing with.
Yes, Katrina.
>> Um, I've actually even used my
recommendations with AI to curate my uh
my resume for specific jobs so that I
can have other people's words influence
and showcase my skills uh at a better
way than just me talking about them. Cuz
I don't sell myself very well, but other
people sell me pretty well. though.
>> Yeah. No, that's an amazing point and
and yes, absolutely. Sometimes, you
know, I I have my and and we will once I
start uh doing our resume specific
sessions. We'll talk about this more,
but I have a resume that I use
to apply for jobs. one that is ATS
compliant.
Um, but I have another one that I give
when I am face to face with interviewers
or recruiters. So, if a recruiter
reaches out to me or someone that is
interested in hiring me, whether
freelance or full-time, and they say,
you know, I'm going to schedule time to
connect with you um for this initial
interview session, I say, fantastic.
Uh when I respond to the confirmation
like I have received the Zoom link,
thank you so much. I'm looking very much
looking forward to connecting with you.
I have attached
a resume
with a deeper dive into my capability
inclusive of recommendations from folks
that I've worked with.
I do that a lot.
So, that's also something to think
about. and why these resume or these
recommendations come in handy, right?
So, thank you uh thank you very much uh
for mentioning that Katrina is that that
sparked that
um thing that I do. Now
you can
draft
um a message you know uh and this is
kind of like again connecting to the
mini exercise that we did right so
a a good example we have but one that we
could also use uh hi Katrina I really
enjoyed working with you during our
capstone stone project. I'm building my
LinkedIn presence and would be grateful
if you'd feel comfortable writing me a
short recommendation.
It would mean a lot if you could mention
how we work together on the backend API
and how I helped with debugging. Thank
you for your consideration.
right now
what I would like for all of you to
think about um if you are able to uh
attend session B we'll be we will be
reviewing everything that I covered but
you know we will be digging a little bit
deeper uh into this session and writing
even more requests for recommendations,
but
send I'd like you all to send at least
one real recommendation request
before session B. So before
6:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.
Okay.
and
optional
write one recommendation
for someone
and I'd love for you to send what you've
written
uh you know for your request and or
your
recommendation that you wrote for
someone throw it to me in Discord.
I'd love to take a look. Now,
how I would like to close before I open
up to some quick questions.
Recommendations are not just about nice
words.
They're proof of how you are as a
professional.
The more thoughtful and specific they
are, the more trust you'll build with
hiring managers and recruiters.
Any questions,
thoughts,
concerns?
What you got for me?
Was this session helpful to all of you?
Yeah.
Cool. And now listen it you can again
and I always say this please please
please never hesitate to reach out to me
directly.
We can meet for 15 minutes. We can meet
for 30 minutes. We can spitball some of
these recommendations.
And most importantly,
do not hesitate to ask me for a
recommendation.
I know all of you. I've been working
with you for several weeks now. Don't
forget about me,
right? I am here not only to help guide
you but
to be your advocate.
I actually already have
pseudo sort of recommendations prepared
for those that I've had the pleasure of
doing phone calls with and I've had
one-on-one screens with all of you. So I
have prepare prepared a lot of notes on
all of you. I've prepared key selling
points
and I've prepared my pitch already
based on our calls, based on our
interactions, based on your resume,
based on your LinkedIn profile. I have
created
what I call my package for you. and in
the recruiter term is I've packaged you
up and I've made it easy
for people like Dr. Kristen and Dr.
Emily.
What if what if Dr. Emily is talking to
a client
that all of you are working on a
project, right?
And the client says, "Hey, Dr. Emily,
I heard from uh client services and
project management or product management
and
it's looking like in January we're going
to need a couple of full stack
developers more on the junior side,
junior to midle. I really enjoyed
working with the students at Joy of
Coding. any recommendations that you
have.
I have made it so that all Dr. Emily or
Dr. Kristen has to do is go in Asana,
find all of you by plugging in your
name, scrolling down in notes, the pitch
is right there.
She can tweak it. She can throw it in
AI. She can add her POV. But this is
what we're preparing. We are preparing a
system
because I keep saying this, it's the
long game, folks.
This is this is a job market that is all
about being prepared,
having your storefront in order. What is
what is our storefront? LinkedIn because
it's the most visible to the public.
So that's our storefront.
Constantly working on that storefront.
constantly editing, constantly building
our summary, constantly asking for
recommendations and giving
recommendations. So, build, build,
build,
working on cover letter templates. We'll
be doing that as well. Constantly
updating our resume. Simple, less is
more. Now, we can start even thinking
about building our part two resume.
But this is the long game
and
shifting
our
mental state into productivity.
So thank you.
Everyone, thank you so much for your
time
and
yeah, send at least one recommendation
request before session B. And if you
have time, bye key. If you've got time,
there you go.
So, he needs the Zoom account. Thank you
very much. And message me with any
questions.
Bye.
