Hello, Anna.
>> Hey, John.
>> Hello. And hey, John.
Be right back. Going to get something to
drink while people are hopping on.
Okay.
>> Hey, John.
>> Hi. How are you?
>> I'm doing good. You look like you're
floating.
>> Like you're floating in space. You
really do.
>> Yeah. I'm sitting here with my little
Chihuahua that I just picked up from a
surgery. So
>> Oh, baby. What happened?
>> She had Okay,
>> it's a Zoom.

I think may have been cancerous. So,
checking it out, but um
>> they got they got it out of her.
>> Is your baby a boy or a girl?
>> It's a girl. That's Piper.

>> I'm going to be moving ne like early
next year. So, I think I want to wait
until
>> Yeah. complete the move.
>> Yeah, it's a big decision.
>> Oh, I will wait for a couple of others.
It is. I know. I want two cats now
because having one I was just like we
need two.
>> Well, so they have a playmate or
something.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah,
>> for sure.
>> Yeah.
>> All right, friends. I don't want to take
up too much time waiting for people that
Jazz is coming.
We've got Melissa
Key is back for a second round.
Hey, Jazz.
Okay,
so we've got some review to do. um
because I did the noon session and theme
of the week is showcasing your skills,
projects and education and that is on
your LinkedIn but you know we've also
kind of tied it into the resume a bit as
well. So I'm going to try to breeze
through this a little since the majority
of you did attend the noon session and I
just will do a quick review. Um, I'll
paste in a couple of of things in the
comments and then we'll start just
diving right in. Um, anyone who wasn't
in uh if there is anyone who was not in
the new session from the beginning and
you're like, "What the heck is going
on?" then just stop me, you know, raise
your raise your little paw and um we can
review everything a little bit slower.
But how I started the noon session was
to
basically talk a little bit about what
this session will do for you. And it
will the goal is to allow you to leave
with clarity um on what skills to list
in your LinkedIn profile as well as your
resume for that matter. how to present
their pro your projects that you are
doing while at uh the TechJoy Career
Academy and and it's important because
the way that Dr. Emily designed this
program was really for you to be an
actual, you know, have an intern and
then graduate to a junior developer so
that you can really hit the ground
running with your application straight
away, right? So, she's been really
strategic and brilliant in in designing
the program to make sure that everyone
leaves with these three six figure
salaries which gonna happen. So um you
it's how to list your projects and how
to leverage the boot camp experience
that you all are are receiving in this
program confidently. Right? So one thing
I I did ask uh everyone to think about
uh when they first joined the session at
noon was and and again carry this
through the entire session.
Um,
we are looking for if if someone looked
at your LinkedIn profile right now,
what would they think your superpower
is?
So, that's just something to think about
and carry with you. Okay.
So
we will and and I also reviewed a little
bit about explaining the difference
between hard skills which are more
technical and soft skills which are more
collaborative and problem solving and
both are important. These are the skills
that you're listing in at the top of
your resume just under your summary. And
they should the skills in your resume,
they absolutely should be listed at the
top of the resume, not toward the
bottom. And that is to make sure that we
are um AI uh and ATS compliant. We want
to make sure that the AI within these
ATS systems are pulling those key
uh those key words straight away
um and so that you're you're being
noticed and your application is being
reviewed. So
the hard skills get you the interview.
The soft skills help you pass it and
keep the job. So let me say that again.
The hard skills get you the interview.
The soft skills help you pass the
interview loop. Typically, you're
meeting with at least three to four
individuals. And then, of course, taking
the technical uh interview.
The soft skills help you pass the
interview loop and keep the job once you
land it.
So, both are essential. Tech is a team
sport. So what's the difference? What is
hard skills versus soft skills? Well,
the hard skills, they are what you can
do,
right? So these are technical teachable
abilities usually learned through
training courses or hands-on experience.
They're easy to measure and often show
up in job description and LinkedIn uh
skills lists, which is why it's
important that these skills are matching
up with the job descriptions of
positions that you're applying to. So
for example for developers you've got
JavaScript react NodeJS git GitHub REST
APIs uh testdriven development uh
debugging using tools like VS Code and
Figma and Postman and you know SQL and
HTML and whatever Python all of those
things those everything I've listed,
these are, you know, these are the the
skills, the the tools that you use every
single day, and they're the tools in
your toolbox. They show what you can
build.
Now, conversely, you've got the soft
skills, and the soft skills are really
about how you work with others. And I'm
sure that you can all start to see this
in others, right, in some of the
projects that you're collaborating with
some of the other students on, right?
Some of you might think, "Oh, wow.
Amazing coder. Really, really knows
their stuff, but sometimes a little
challenging to work with." Or, "Yeah,
you know what? This person might not be
the strongest like full stack developer.
Amazing low code, amazing personality. I
love being around this person. They're
collaborative. They're, you know,
vivacious. They're positive.
Um, and they're team, you know, all
about the team and and just really about
creative problem solving. I love working
with that person. Can go both ways,
right? Sometimes the soft skills are way
more important than the hard skills
oftent times. So it these are are
interpersonal
and communicationbased abilities.
They help you thrive on a team, solve
problems and adapt. Adaptability, it's a
really strong uh soft skill. Feel free
to you list that on your resume if you
feel that aligns with who you are.
That's an example, right? So, they're
harder to quantify, but just as
important and often the reason people
get hired or promoted.
I have worked with quite a few
individuals on HR teams, resource
management teams, talent acquisition
teams that do the bare minimum,
but
they're there. One person in particular
that I worked with at a company, she's
the uh recruiter that focuses on
freelance roles for the creatives at the
agency. She's so challenging to work
with.
She's she's tough, right? And it's not
an easy environment and you kind of have
to be tough when you're dealing with a
payroll department at a massive
corporate creative advertising agency in
New York City and you know she has to
deal with finance and payroll and CFO
and the CCO.
She's tough.
Just had a I just had a shiver. Um okay.
Yes, Melissa. I'm working on it, but at
the moment I can't hear anything or say
anything. Oh, I'm sorry, Melissa.
We got some technical difficulties.
However, um would I
raise my hand to work with that person
again? Probably. Um I can work with
anyone. Uh but I know some folks that
kind of steer clear of this person. So,
the soft skills can be very very
important. problem solving,
communication, time management,
adaptability, there's that word again,
teamwork and collaboration, empathy,
giving and receiving feedback. Big, big
one, big one. so important especially as
you grow in your positions and you are
hiring folks and you're mentoring and
managing more junior talent, you'll have
that opportunity and you'll know you'll
see that that's important. So, think of
soft skills as how you use your tools,
how well you work with others while
doing it.
Okay. Any any quick questions so far?
Okay, I'm gonna keep going. So again, I
think we've discussed how some of the
recruiter secrets that I've let you all
in on. ATS and LinkedIn recruiter
heavily relies on the skills section
skills and this the skills in your
profile should match those in the job
description and in the resume.
For the most part, you all are going to
be applying for
um
the the positions that you'll be
applying for are a little bit less
nuanced than some roles that I've
sourced for. I think that where there
might be a difference is if you are
someone who would be open to working uh
or open to applying to roles that are
low code but full stack as well. In that
case, I would recommend that you curate
your LinkedIn profile to be very broad
to cover skills that span low code and
full stack development. Now, with your
resumes, if you're going for applying
for low code positions and full stack,
maybe even some like backend hardcore
coding positions,
two separate resumes.
I would anyway. I think it would be
easier for you to have those different
resumes curated so that you can just
boom boom boom send them out and then
it's the followup. That's really
important and we're going to start
working on that. I'll be I'm have been
in discussions all day today with Dr.
Emily about integrating some
processes
that we will be implementing with the
job hunt for those that are actively
applying who are interns and junior
developers. So, we'll be pushing pretty
hard and making sure that you are
networking,
posting on LinkedIn because again, these
are things that get you noticed and we
want to make sure that you are
maximizing every single resource and
that we and again, you know, you've got
all of these people here to support you.
You've got other students, you've got
me, you've got Dr. Emily. I keep
mentioning Katrina because she is just
so phenomenal and as just a support
system like take away all the other
amazing things that she does but she's a
great you know she's like my my warm
blanket she's just
she is a a wonderful support as well. So
use all of us as a resource.
Now,
what what I'd like to do quickly is I'd
like to share my screen and I would I
hope that this can can work. I set up a
few LinkedIn profiles.
Lisa Dan. All right.
Um, so I set up a couple of profiles
and
Oops. What happened here? Here we go.
So, setting up a couple of profiles on
the my screen above me.
And because I've reduced the screen, I
don't know how well this will be
visible, but the idea that I wanted was
for you to
review a couple review both of these
profiles
and tell me which one you feel is
stronger.
starting from the top. So starting from
the photo, the banner,
the name,
the headline.
Okay. And now you've got also an about
section here.
I'll give you a couple of minutes to
look and see. Just kind of take it all
in.
And this is just,
you know, this is a a safe to fail
exercise.
And
we really look working mostly with the
top portion and the summary. But I am
going to also scroll down just a bit.
Activity.
Ali's been in the industry for quite
some time. Check this out.
He doesn't have any activity.
Maurice does.
Ree looks like he's got some some
activity
posting things, reposting.
And then we've got some experience here.
nice breath of experience, you know,
that they both have.
Let's see.
Uh, yeah, we've got skills. They both
have noted skills for each role.
Education, they've got that listed.
Great.
Okay, looks like Ali listed some
projects.
Okay, Maurice has some recommendations
as does Ali.
Pretty dated though.
Courses.
Wow, Morice speaks eight languages. It's
impressive.
All right,
so just from that
quick
review,
what do you guys think? Who's the
strongest? Any any thoughts?
anyone?
>> Yeah, I I didn't get to see the whole
thing. Um, but I I think Maurice's was
um he looked uh it's his his uh
description of him of himself and what
he was looking for just seemed a little
bit more personable than the other guys.
um from what I was reading that
>> um like yeah like he you know like he
would be easier to get along with or
something. I don't know. But then the
yeah the other the other guy seemed a
little bit uh more like um
I don't know maybe professional but a
little bit more like robotic right like
less personable.
>> Um and like you said there was there
wasn't that activity there on on
LinkedIn so like he's not really
interacting with with people there. So
>> yeah.
>> Yeah,
>> you get you get what I'm going for
there. So
>> yeah.
>> Yeah. And by no means does this mean
that Ali is no good at what he does. I
mean, clearly he is and he does a great
job. One thing as a recruiter that
drives me nuts
is when someone doesn't put their last
name or they abbreviate anything in
their names.
>> Drives me crazy.
>> Like how am I supposed to find you? I
mean skills. Yes, but it it it can be a
little as a recruiter like I I just want
to know who you are so I can do my job.
>> Yeah.
>> Anyhow. Anyhow. Oh, good.
>> Yeah.
>> So, moving on. Um let's talk about
framing the projects that you all
currently do. Um and and you all have
this experience and I'm going to just
like run through this because I we we
did go through this. So um
it the objective here is to
teach you to turn projects that you work
on in this current uh boot camp or
academy
um into credibility builders.
This is the whole point and this is what
Dr. Emily why this is the real true
method to her madness, right? She wants
to make sure that you have real projects
as examples to show for you to talk
about in interviews
so that you put them on your resume on
LinkedIn so it builds your credibility.
So
what is the best framework
for something like this and how do I
explain this and where do I put it? So
for the most part you'll be putting this
in two different places, right? You'll
be putting it in LinkedIn and your
resume and it's going to look two
different ways and we'll look at that in
just a moment. But let me put the uh
formula in the chat so that you can pull
this information. So
what
the framework is
you list what the project is,
what tools you used
to build it and what you built. What was
the impact and the result that it had?
Okay.
So, let's oops.
All right.
So, an example is
built a full stack budgeting app using
React, NodeJS, and MongoDB
that allowed users to track expenses.
designed UI for intuitive UX deployed
with Netlefi
reduced friction for new users by 25% in
testing.
This is just an example
but it's you can see that there is the
what is
what tools you used what you built and
what the impact or the result had. So, I
just copy and pasted that just as an
example.
Any questions on that?
Let's move on to showing you some more
examples of this. So
the
this also ties into
highlighting the boot camp or
highlighting Techjoy Academy and your
education
and how to sort of use this
project template to build
the explanation of what you did at
TechJoy or anywhere any other boot camps
that you may have taken or
certifications or even uh listing your
education.
So, what you want to make sure that you
do is
emphasize
even though it's not like you went and
got a master's in computer science from
Yale. Okay, great to have. Sure. But a
boot camp is more than course work. It's
full-on project-based learning. And
again, that's the brilliance of this
program that that Dr. Emily has created.
It
the idea is to highlight capstone
projects and collaboration skills. So,
you know, you name Techjoy Academy or
the other boot camp or certification
course you may have taken. You list the
technologies that you learned, notable
projects. you make sure to mention those
and any additional certifications.
Right? So, it's going to look different
in LinkedIn slightly different in format
than it does in your resume. So, let's
take a look at that.
Everyone see my screen? Nod.
Yes. See Hope's nod. Thank you. Okay.
So, we have the LinkedIn version and
this is
it says that you can add this under the
education section. Okay. So, you're
listing it Techjoy Academy
full stack web development certification
program and the dates.
Then you list the technologies that you
learned,
notable projects,
and any kind of certifications that may
accompany.
So notice the structure. Let's go
through it again.
name, TechJoy Academy, the type of
certification program, the date, the
technologies that you learned, notable
projects that you can talk about in any
interview flawlessly
with no trepidation, no ums, no
like
fluid,
articulated
confident
and any certifications that might
accompany.
Now, here is the resume version.
Slightly different.
Does the same
but in a more condensed form.
Techjoy Academy
certification and full full stack
development. The date where this was the
formatting was a little bit different.
Now you've got bullets.
Completed the immersive six week program
focused on modern web development
practices, collaboration, project work,
technologies, key projects,
certifications.
Boom.
Clear,
confident,
organized, concise.
questions.
Cool.
So
this evening for the next 30 minutes,
what I'm hoping to do is
have a little bit more peer-to-peer
and peerto coach feedback in real time
while you update your LinkedIn profiles.
Okay. So,
if you'd like to participate,
pull up your LinkedIn profile
and
what was one takeaway from what we
reviewed just now that
you had from what I just mentioned? Was
there a key takeaway that any of you
would like to mention?
Oh man,
Melissa, yes.
uh the project um formula that you put
in the chat. Um I had what it was and
what um what I built but I didn't have
the tools that I used or the impact that
it had and adding that I think makes it
more powerful. Makes it pop more.
>> Yeah, I like that. Makes it pop. It
does. I like that. Thank you, Melissa.
Anybody else?
>> I just wanted to say that I am going to
be doing that when I can get back to my
computer where right now I'm on my
phone, so I can't really participate,
but
>> I'm taking it all in. I want you to know
I appreciate it. I just I don't have
anything to share on it right now. So
>> Oh, good. Oh, good. You can be you can
like hang with me and and be like
evaluating and like checking it all out.
Yeah.
>> So, Thank you.
>> Let's Let's see if we can do a little
bit. Um
let me see what can we do here.
Let's
work perhaps in some breakout rooms.
Okay.
What I'd like you all to do is work with
each other to rewrite one project
description
using the framework
that I previously provided
and we'll have some volunteers
read out um you know read aloud some of
the feedback.
>> Can you repeat that? I didn't get it. We
are to do what now? I didn't catch at
all.
>> Yeah.
>> So, we will have uh I will put you all
in breakout rooms and we will have you
rewrite
one project description
using the framework that I provided in
the uh ins.
Yeah.
And anyone that is uh using their phone,
it it's fine. You know, you can kind of
still participate. Okay, so
Whoa, where did this go? I did not see
my breakout rooms anymore.
Oh man.
Me see host tools.
Maybe we won't be doing breakout rounds.
It's for some reason. Hold on a second.
This is why
there it is. Okay.
Oh, here we go. Let me see.
Okay, here we go. I think this.
All right, John and Lisa.
Let me recreate.
Okay, here we go. Give me one minute,
folks.
All right.
sign.
What happened?
Oops.
What happened?
Huh? Let's
[Music]
show
I'm really sorry. I have to go. I just
got a a call. Um so I'm I'm sorry. Um
Chelsea. Um
>> Okay. No problem.
>> Okay. Okay, bye.
>> Thank you. Bye.
I accidentally hit the button instead of
closing out the one minute thing.
I haven't made to actually leave yet.
Sorry, Lisa. I didn't mean to leave. I
accidentally hit the button.
>> Oh, no worries. That's all right. It
happens.
>> No problem.
Okay. Is everyone here?
And how
John, Lisa, Melissa? Okay. Very cool.
So, everyone
um how'd you do?
>> Can I finish up with uh Anna real fast?
I was telling her something that it's
relative relevant.
>> Yeah. So Anna was trying to figure out
how she's going to like kind of quantify
what she's done for the support local
project and I was telling her because
she's new to that and I you know I've
been through it.
>> So she's gonna was telling her that
she's going to be using the tickets that
she've done she's done and I know for a
fact she's done some test tickets,
right? So you could you could write um
>> beautiful
>> in some way how you've been uh writing
test files for the project, right? So I
mean and then you're going to keep track
of, you know, the tickets that you've
done and you're going to, you know,
maybe even put them into AI to to have
them spice it up for you to make it
sound better for your resume. That's all
I was going to say.
>> Yeah. Yeah.
Thank you.
I jotted that down.
>> Absolutely.
How um what else would you guys would
would anyone else like to share?
>> Um Lisa was talking about she was in she
was involved in the challenge week. Um
>> Okay. Yeah. She was pretty busy when I
spoke to her last week. I I think a lot
of people were involved in that. Yeah.
>> Oh yeah. Yeah. And they all had a blast
it sounds like. But um she was trying to
figure out how to how to write that up
with all the different things that they
did and she described it to me and I
suggested kind of the same along the
same lines as what John said is to take
that description that she gave me throw
that into AI and then take the formula
that you gave us in the chat and put
that in the prompt
>> and just even if it's just a starting
point you can always tweak it to
>> always. Yeah. I don't think I've ever
put anything in AI that I didn't end up
tweaking myself, but but it gives you a
really good solid like starting point.
>> Yep. No. Anyone else?
>> John, you
>> uh I told you I couldn't really work on
mine right now because I'm not really in
front of my computer. So,
>> oh good. That can be the homework.
>> That can be homework.
>> But I have another sort of little
engagement idea. Just like a little pop
quiz sort of thing. So, what's one
sentence
that makes
TechJoy Academy sound impressive without
overselling it?
How would you describe
TechJoy Academy?
>> Well, what you referenced earlier, I
would talk about how they're like real
life projects that we eventually end up
working on once we get into the
internship, which is like such a
wonderful way to learn, I think, rather
than, you know, just like studying
courses or whatever when you're thrown
into a real life situation.
Um, and you you're forced to learn
things you don't even uh really realize
that you're you're learning.
>> Um, and they're all relevant obviously
to like a real life job because it's
real life stuff. And um, Dr. Emily also
mentions how the people that are hiring,
they all want to see that you've brought
something to production. That's a big
uh, very big step.
>> So,
>> Yep. Yep. And that's what she's that's
how she's curated the program, which is
pretty fantastic.
>> Yeah, I agree.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Amazing. Um, now, how
many of you I think John and Melissa, I
know that both of you are actively
starting to apply. I know Melissa,
you've you've started applying quite a
bit, right? Um, oh, are you applying to
positions right now?
>> No, I'm not. Not yet.
>> Okay. Okay. And Anna, Lisa, Lisa, I've
helped uh we've we talked last week, so
I know that you're actively applying as
well. Anna, are you where are you in the
program right now?
>> Um, I haven't started applying yet.
>> Okay, that's cool. I just want to get an
idea myself
because so
Melissa,
when you have a moment,
can you would you mind sending me your
job hunt tracker? Maybe sharing it with
me in Gmail.
>> Yeah,
>> or or or
however you wish to do it because I'm
not altering it. I just really want to
look at it. So, you can also make it a
PDF and send it to me in Discord, too.
Whatever is easier for you. I don't care
either way.
>> Um, John, do you have a job hunt
spreadsheet thing though?
>> So, I actually finally just started
applying yesterday. So, I've applied to
>> two jobs now. And, uh, finally on the on
the weekly check-in, I can actually hit
yes on that question about whether or
not I'm applying for jobs. And then
>> and then it'll prompt me to write to say
which jobs, you know, the tracker or
whatever. So
>> next week I'll have the tracker ready.
>> Okay. Locked and loaded. Good. Um,
okay. I'd still like to see or like, you
know, if you can send me uh the link to
the jobs that you applied to, company
name, that sort of thing on Discord. I
just want to see. Curious.
>> Okay.
>> Yeah.
>> Did you guys see um the job postings
that Suzie Q
Susie Q?
>> Yeah. Did y'all did any of you apply to
those? Because
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah.
>> I'm actually in the process of applying
to one of them right now.
>> What job posting?
>> Very good.
>> It was in the job hunt thread. Um,
>> yes.
>> Oh, okay. I I have not even jumped over
there yet.
>> It's in the first server. There's two
different servers that both have a job
hunt page or whatever.
>> It's in Joy of Coding.
>> Joy of Coding. Yeah. Joy.
>> Yeah,
>> I've seen I've seen it. I haven't.
>> And sure that if you apply, make sure
that you let Susie know because
referral bonuses happen at agencies and
and
the fact that you know someone at this
company.
You want to make sure that the someone
can advocate for you. So you raise your
hand say, "Hey Susie,
I saw that you posted those jobs. Thank
you. This is what I applied to
>> just so that you know. Thank you so
much." give her just give her the heads
up because again at all different types
of companies they have referral bonuses
too and we want to make sure that since
Susie did us a solid posted those
positions at her company and gave
everybody you know a good reference if
one if one of you gets hired and there's
a referral bonus at that company which
there usually is you want to make sure
that Susie gets compensated and most of
the time it's some pretty serious cash
money. It's anywhere from I've seen I've
seen referral bonuses upwards to 15
grand
especially at tech companies.
>> So that's cash money right there in your
pocket.
>> I've seen it around 600 but 15 grand.
Whoa.
>> Yeah. Yep. Yep. I've seen it. Yep. At a
couple of the advertising agencies that
I worked at. Um and it depends on level
at least at the advertising agencies
that I have been at. They're more junior
roles. The the you know posi the the
cash payouts a little bit less
for more senior level roles and hiring
managers usually are not um allowed to
get them. But, you know, anybody most
people if you're making over a certain
amount of money a year, then they tend
to not give the referral bonus, but for
the most part. So, it was just someone
like Susie, she'd get the referral
bonus. So, we want to make sure we do
her a solid since she did us a solid.
>> Yeah. I just I just talked to Susie
before this and what she's basically
able what she's able to do for us
basically is to get us the interview
like you know to bypass or
>> because they have to go through so many
resumes and they may not even see yours
while she can actually make it so we get
an interview but beyond that I'm not
sure but that's that's a big step
though.
>> That's how I got my last job. I knew
somebody and they just
>> hired me on it.
me because I knew the person.
>> Yes, it's networking. It's all about
networking. Like, yes, all of this due
diligence that we do with the resume and
and the LinkedIn profile, it it it, you
know, seems like busy work, but again,
this is the reput your representation
like your reputation, your digital
reputation
on LinkedIn. And then, of course, your
resume. The reason why we are meticulous
in structuring it the way that we do is
because now we've got AI to contend
with. Before we only had lazy recruiters
and I am a recruiter and I will tell you
right now there's a lot
uh so much so that I am flabbergasted.
Um you know a lot of recruiters don't
even bother looking at the applications
in the ATS systems.
Now, I'm sure that there is uh some sort
of accountability. I always did, always
looked because sometimes there's that
unicorn that you find, that needle in
the hay stack. There's always one.
But we just, you know, we are this is
the this is how we're representing
ourselves, right? Because we have
integrity for the work that we do. they
have integrity for our the other
teammates, other students that were in
the trenches with us. Dr. Emily, right?
So, there's a lot of representation and
credibility that we are um
curating in these in the resume and the
LinkedIn profile. And I know it it seems
tedious and it definitely is,
but
always want to make sure that you're
buttoned up and you're ready to go
because you never know when someone like
Susie is going to post in another job
and say, "This is wow." And you look at
some of these job, this is it. This is
the one.
And you're ready to hit the ground
running. You don't have to stress about
making edits and going crazy.
Just come correct straight away.
So, I I'm seeing a big uh question is
I'm seeing a big um Can you hear me?
>> Yes, I can.
>> Yep.
>> A big um
a lot of job. Well, what I'm what we did
this past week with AI centered
uh programming
and after the president announced his uh
AI initiatives
um that's going to be a huge
huge uh huge calling for or from
companies for AI specific programmers or
AI no
>> lowers. Yeah, I think so. I think I
think that Dr. Emily is right too that
it's really going to be folks as well
that that know how to, you know, partner
with AI and use it to enhance the work
that they do, right?
>> Yeah.
Well, that challenge definitely helped
seriously because um I was stumbling
with that AI with the the ticket I was
on with support local
>> and then doing the challenge I realized
my approach was totally wrong. I was
just going out there to chat GPT. Most
folks was using this through the eyed
and then it's the way they asked the
question and let me tell you I decided
well let me take that approach that I
learned and so all and I just brought my
my project back to square one. I just
brought down the main and created a
branches. I'm going to just do it this
new way and not and a stumbling way. And
I got that ticket to work where in the
scrum meeting it passed and they merged
it. I was sitting there like, "Okay,
>> excellent.
>> I'm learning."
>> Nice. I love when that happens.
>> Aha moment. And it was because of the
challenge.
Um, and and Melissa and John, especially
John, because I know Melissa, you've
been applying uh pretty steadily over
the past couple of months. But John,
since you're just starting, you know, if
you want my help, if there's anything
that you need from me, just make sure
you you reach out. Don't be shy.
>> Okay. I appreciate it. Um, yeah. I I
have to actually sit down and actually
like look at which ones I want to apply
for now because I hadn't really uh had
the time to before. I've just been kind
of browsing here and there, but like now
I'm actually like I'm actually doing it.
So, um,
>> I'll let you know if I if I need help. I
appreciate that.
>> Yeah. But see, now that I know that you
have Piper, I will only talk to you when
Piper is in the screen.
Oh, I actually came down. Okay.
>> No, no, no.
>> Yeah,
>> I'm sorry.
>> I am not gonna talk to you unless Piper
is involved.
>> No, she's she's got a boo boo. Don't get
her now. Let her chill. She just had an
operation. She has a cone.
>> She probably just wants to just eat and
chill and get snuggles like
>> Yeah, exactly.
>> Let's Let's let her chill. But moving
forward when she's
>> Jesse, you're awesome.
>> I don't want anything to do with humans.
I rather deal with animals.
>> Yeah,
>> I'm just kidding. Except for Except for
all of you. Um, but I see like a little
cute Chihuahua and that's that's it.
That's that's I'm
>> Oh gosh. A
>> Lisa, who is that? Who is that big sweet
pee?
That That's a big That's a chunky
monkey.
Oh, I love them. I love I love animals.
I'm sorry, guys. I just like drop
everything for anything with fur. I'm
not really like a lizard pet kind of
person or uh maybe a ferret. Looks too a
little too much like a rodent. But
>> gotcha.
>> I do. I do.
And if you're a little snappy, little
fresh.
>> Yeah, if you're fresh, I kind of like
you even a little bit more if you've got
a little bit of an attitude.
>> I like that.
>> Hey, Chelsea, are you going to be around
after this meeting? Because I have some
questions for you, but I wanted I would
like it to be offline. Would that make
>> Yeah. Yeah. Um, you know what? I don't
after this meeting, but if you I do have
time tomorrow.
>> Okay. So, if you wouldn't mind doing me
a favor and sending me your availability
in Discord to connect tomorrow for about
a half hour. Do you think a half hour
will cover it?
>> Yep.
>> Yeah. Um, send me like a handful of
timing options in Eastern Standard Time.
That would really help me.
>> Yeah, I'm over here in South Carolina,
so that worked just fine.
Okay. All right. South Kakalaka.
I wish I was down there.
Good food.
Friends, anything else that we can chat
about? We have two more minutes. How
else can I help you?
>> Um, maybe on one of your sessions,
Chelsea, if you could um
help us to or if we have hobbies or
other activities, you're not coding
specifically how we can
>> okay
>> put those in or you know things that
also
>> are they
>> but they're sort of they they are
aligned with development or no like is
it knitting
>> well it might
>> you know what I mean like
>> it might showcase other talents that we
have.
>> Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Yeah. Let
me think about that. I mean, I've got my
yoga teacher training. So, I have that
certifi type of certification
>> that and and I had list ended up listing
that on my resume because I ended up
teaching yoga at one of the agencies
that I worked that had me do that at
night. So, that's why I listed it. But
yeah, um there are certainly things that
could be relevant can be relevant, but
let me just do a little bit of more
research on that
>> to see how to structure that.
>> What's that, John?
>> Yeah, I was going to say, you remember
you told us to put those things on our
LinkedIn at least, if not on the resume,
you could definitely put it on your
LinkedIn. Your LinkedIn page. Yeah.
Okay.
>> Yeah. Yeah, because that's the more
human. But, you know, I don't know, like
I feel like
if you went to school for like art or
art history
or if you
are a sculptor
or a poet
or
you've done like
and I mentioned this in the last
session, but you know a soft skill is
being able to be client-f facing,
peerfacing,
have gravitas, be able to lead client
meetings and and presentations.
And when I was hiring juniors at one of
the agencies that I worked at, Junior
Creatives, you know, I would sit in some
of their war room
uh sessions and listen to their client
presentations and I would evaluate who
had, you know, that sort of innate
presence and gravitas
and those who didn't, those who were
like kind of shy that kind of stumbled
played with their hands,
stuttered. We would send them to Upright
Citizens Brigade, which is a uh
improvisation comedy
um program, and they would then
perform
>> and it really did make them it it really
helped.
So maybe listing something like that
aligns as well. Not sure about the
resume. I want to do a little bit deeper
research about that. But definitely the
LinkedIn hope. Like if you're a
sculptor, gardening,
if you bake pies, I want to know about
that immediately.
Anyone
knows a great good recipe um for
Jamaican beef patties, let me know. My
husband's looking. He loves them and he
makes the city.
>> Those are delicious.
>> Where they used to have the best ones.
Oh,
yeah. But a lot of a lot of food is no
good in upstate New York. And I was
spoiled because the city has some of,
you know, the best food and incredible
culture and you can get anything you
want at any time, anytime, anywhere.
>> And uh then I'm up in upstate New York
where I grew up and I I remember how sad
the food is.
>> Like slice of pizza, don't do it. I'd
rather die. I rather starve.
>> So, but yeah,
>> I grew up in upstate New York, too.
Oh, you did. Whereabouts? The
>> Well, someone where I'm kind of
embarrassed now about
the home of Kodak.
East.
>> Oh, what is that? What is that? Pipsy.
>> No, an hour and 45 minutes um east of
Buffalo.
>> Oh, okay. Syracuse.
>> No, it's an hour and a half east of
Syracuse.
>> Okay. So it's like in the middle.
>> Yeah, you're you're you are a true
you're a true upset. I'm in like the
capital district. Capital, but I'm
moving back to the city.
>> Okay.
>> Yeah. My husband and I miss the food too
much. So for life,
>> folks don't realize two different type
of culture. New York state versus the
city.
>> And you know, everyone food is very
important.
>> Yeah.
>> Yes.
>> There's some good states.
good piece of where I was brought up at
though.
>> Oh, well, you know what? Not where I am.
So, sad sad days.
>> But I worked with folks that were from
the island, Sicily, and they
>> up and they knew what they were doing.
They knew what they were doing.
>> Yes.
>> So, everyone, please reach out to me.
Anna, please let me know when you're
available tomorrow. We can definitely
hook up. Anyone has any other questions?
Um, and if um, I I hope that you enjoyed
this and we will start integrating other
things um, into these sessions. So,
thank you all so much. Have a great
>> Thank you, Chelsea. You're
>> welcome.
Have a good evening.
>> Bye to Lisa's Kitty and to Piper.
>> Thank you.
