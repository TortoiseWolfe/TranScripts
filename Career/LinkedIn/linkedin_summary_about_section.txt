Career Strategy w/ Chelsea - LinkedIn Summary / About Section
https://youtu.be/EbDidul7XBc

Hey.
Hello everyone. I am very sorry for my
lateness. I was having some technical
difficulties.
But I'm trying to get everybody in now.
Who else is there? Hi John. Hi Kylie.
>> Liz Ripple. Hello.
Who else is here? Hope Leo.
>> Hi. Get off me. Got eight people today.
Hello.
And Mercury is still retrograding, so
I'm still going to have technical
difficulties.
If anyone is into astrology,
>> you know, Alyssa really is. Have you
talked to Alyssa? She's into astrology.
>> Oh, is she? I love that.
>> Yeah. I'm gonna have to reach out to her
about it. Awesome. Well, we've got a
good amount of people here and we are
running a little bit behind and I want
to be respectful of your time. So, um,
we are going to be continuing our
LinkedIn adventure
and we are going to be moving on to our
summary. So, you know, just to
um
you know, recap a little bit. So, you
know, welcome back to our Tuesday
sessions. Um again, we have it at noon
and at 6. Uh so, week one, we really dug
in into why LinkedIn matters. We talked
about LinkedIn's role in the job search,
how recruiters use it as a first step in
finding uh finding out about
individuals. Uh we discussed what makes
a profile great from content and
strategy perspective.
Um and then last week we talked about
setting up the basis. So, you know, we
covered photos, contact info, banners,
and how small visual cues build trust.
We had you do a live edit of your
profiles during the session and um we
talked a little bit about writing um and
workshopping
the um sort of the the headline. So we
learned what makes it strong keyword
rich um and how did did anyone work a
little bit on any of that this week?
Anyone have any issues? Anyone have any
questions?
All right,
good. So, this week uh as I had
mentioned um we are going to talk about
the about session um uh aka your
summary. So you know by the end of this
session you will learn you know a simple
structure to help you tell your story
even if you're in the early phases of
your career or if you are making a shift
from one career to the other in one
segment to the other right so we will um
review some strong examples of LinkedIn
summaries and you know we'll talk about
leaving a framework for for how you can
start crafting those summaries. Um in my
evening session if you are able to join
then uh we will here's Ruby
we will be uh basically drafting
um and uh having peer reviews of the
summary. So it will you know give you an
opportunity to have a look at other
summary other folks summaries and also
um you know what
um are good just hearing about how other
students in the program are approaching
the summary and also how it's a little
bit different than the summary that you
would write in your resume than in your
LinkedIn profile. profile. Your LinkedIn
profile is the human you like you know
where you can really show who you are as
a person and then how that person uh
shows up in the the workplace and as a
coder either full stack or low code or
wherever you are focusing your passion
within this um developer segment. So, um
I see that there were some comments.
Uh Ripple, okay, first time attending.
Well, you know what, Ripple, if you have
any specific questions for me off uh
outside of this meeting, that's totally
fine. Let me know. Um and
Ivan, thank you for joining us. It's
great to have you. Um there should be
recorded sessions. Yes, Ivan, they were
all recorded. Um, but uh, you know, you
can also obviously
um, reach out to me directly at any any
time. Um, so let's start digging in a
little bit to this session.
Now, crafting a compelling summary.
Now
[Music]
what is the summary section? Um you know
it it appears in your LinkedIn profile
just under um you know your headline
your uh name how you identify the
contact content info or contact info
sorry with your uh
your email address your LinkedIn profile
link your GitHub and then of course if
you have a profile or or port portfolio
or any other projects that you might
want to highlight, that would be the
place to do it. And then right
underneath all of that where your banner
is, you um have your summary. So it it's
really one of the few narrative parts of
LinkedIn and it shows up in search
results and gives a voice to your
resume. So, your LinkedIn profile though
it's it's it's the first step that a
recruiter takes when they're looking at
who is John, who is Ruby, who's Liz,
who's Eric, who are they, who's this
person that is applying. Um, though it
is the first step, it's
it's the narrative part of who you are.
the resumeéé is more representative of
your personal history. And now yes,
LinkedIn does do that, but
your resume is the more formal document
um uh and the sort of legacy uh formal
legacy of your work history. So what
makes a summary work? So there are some
core elements of a strong summary.
Clear and confident opening line. Okay.
A sense of who you are and and what
you're about professionally,
what you're working on now and looking
for. So you can I would say mentioning a
possible
um previous experience
works. Um and I will use a a one of the
students that uh I've been working with
and who is on this call today. Kai, I
hope you don't mind using you as an
example, but you are absolutely perfect
for this. Um and then a sentence or two
that reflects your personality, your
values, your motivation and you know a
call to action is also nice to have. It
is an option. Um but you know open to
networking, hiring or collaboration.
It really does depend. Um now as an
example
um you know Kai is someone who has had a
wide breath of experience within the
architecture field
and his background though it is more I
would say
technical but leaning more on the
creative side
um it definitely
can overlap with uh software development
and um any kind of like uh AI or
anything that we're focusing on within
full stack and low code. So I think that
mentioning
uh the fact that I has spent uh you know
so many years within the architecture
field definitely is something that that
he can mention within his summary in
that summary and then also in your
summary and about on your resume.
If you are someone who has had a wide
breath of experience in a certain
industry, I would say anywhere from
10 plus years,
avoid putting the amount of years that
you've been in the industry. Also, avoid
words like seasoned.
And then of course if you are a spy or
if you are more of a junior developer or
junior producer, junior art director,
junior copywriter,
you can omit that. And I think that
that's something that I am going to um
individually reach out to a couple of
folks that I've helped them uh with some
focused attention on their resume
because I have been uh reading some uh
articles about best practices for
resumeé and LinkedIn writing and I've
also reached out to and have had
conversations with a couple of um folks
that I've worked with in the past. They
are recruiters, a chief talent officer,
a few directors of HR and directors of
talent acquisition across advertising,
tech startups and technology companies.
And the consensus uh real world
consensus that I have found is to leave
out words like seasoned and junior and
aspiring.
Like that's all great and we can tell by
your uh resume and LinkedIn profile if
you are um a junior in anything. Um,
even if you are coming right out of
school as an entrylevel graduate or
someone who is a in a career shift, it's
all right. We can see by the resume.
Let's just keep things ambiguous in that
regard. There is no need to let people
know that you've had 25 plus years of
experience in a certain industry. We'll
be able to find that out. We are
wonderful sleuths though. Um wanting to
make sure that I am making that clear in
uh you know in this sort of meeting uh
because
I sort of uh have been using uh
contradicting language and I just want
to be clear because I wasn't clear in my
own head about it how I felt. Um so now
that I have gotten some support from
colleagues that I trust and that are
recruiting right now for uh roles of all
levels.
I wanted to make sure that I I gave you
all that uh update. Are there any
questions questions before I go into the
best practices for the LinkedIn summary?
>> Yes.
Yeah. So, the junior thing, that's
that's new to me uh to hear. Um because
you know how our whole thing is we get
promoted to junior developer as the last
thing. So, you're saying though to take
that off of like our LinkedIn and our
resume. So, it'll just say like that
we've been a developer for the last I
don't know it backdates a little bit for
us. So, like 3 months or something.
Don't say junior developer. just say
>> yeah you know you don't even have to you
don't even have to write anything
specific like I've been a developer for
three months
>> it I would you know the summary is to
>> as we will continue on with this
workshop and workshopping every this
summary out with other students in the
evening
it's really delivering. It's it's about
selling yourself and it's delivering
where you are now and where you want to
be in the future. And you can certainly
make mention like with Kai um having an
architecture
uh background
it aligns if you were
you know working in IT if you've been
perhaps uh doing QA or uh some more low
code focused duties within your career
over the past several years. Mentioning
that work, but just there's no need to
mention how many years you've been doing
it.
That is for a conversation in a initial
phone screen with a recruiter.
That's when you start to talk about well
in the past this is what I've been doing
and it's led me to this point where I am
focusing on shifting gears a bit and
moving into web development and this is
where I see myself going with this. This
is the goal.
>> Yeah. I um I just wanted to make the
distinction because it's kind it's
interesting because part of the reason
like we were you know interesting
connotations for this program um because
part of the reasons that we were doing
the junior developer thing is so that we
could put it on our resume but in
essence now if we're taking off the
junior we're basic we're basically yeah
just going to developer like right off
the you know I mean I don't know if
there's a difference between the junior
and senior but it's like we're being to
put on a resume, right? You know,
developer instead of like a junior
developer.
>> We're really talking about the summary.
That's the focus. Okay.
>> Right. Okay.
>> So, when you get a little bit further
down in your LinkedIn profile and your
resume where you're talking about
joy of coding,
>> okay,
>> junior developer,
>> that's where you can make mention of it.
But in the summary and in for LinkedIn
and your resume,
>> there's really no need to say that.
>> There's really no need to say I am a
junior developer.
>> We'll see that further down in the
resume. We'll understand that from the
years of experience that we notice. And
if your title, which at Joy of Coding
>> um and yes, Ruby, you're you're you are
accurate. There are people that um do
not put junior anywhere on their resume.
Um, if your specific title that you were
given by an organization,
if it was junior software developer,
junior copywriter, junior art director,
I would advise to
state that very clearly
because
then it often times look like looks like
you're skirting around the fact that you
are a junior.
Okay.
>> And you're expecting the money of a
senior because there are junior,
mid-level, senior, and then it kind of
goes up. Does that make sense?
>> Yeah.
>> Okay. And you know the the the
>> for a cover letter tie, I think it
depends on the context. I think it
depends on the position that you're
applying for because the cover letter
accompanies an application
and accompanies a resume.
The cover letter is talking about why
you are a fit for the role that you're
applying to. it comes at it's it's a
supporting document
to the resume.
So I don't really see why you need to
say again I'm a junior developer.
Okay, we could but still I can see that
on your resume. I can see once you get a
little bit further down and you start
listing your positions, that's when it
becomes important because then we're
seeing the growth and the your career
trajectory. And you know what? Sometimes
a recruiter might say, "Wow, you were a
junior uh in your position. Uh that was
your title at IBM for the past couple of
years. you know, you really got must
have received uh some great mentorship
and you got a lot of wonderful
opportunity because you speak like a
senior like and you can skip levels
depending on the role that you're being
presented with and you could just be a
real snappy junior developer that's on
top of their game and they put you
immediately in a role that does not have
junior in the title. But for all
intensives intents and purposes for
joy of coding your title when you leave
and your last step right is a junior
developer. That's the point of the
program to give you that experience as a
junior developer. Now you might step
into another junior developer developer
role. That's possible. Titles also vary
tremendously from organization to
organization.
Does all of this make sense or
any any questions on this?
Okay.
So, some best practices for a tech
developer focused summary
and really all summaries for your
LinkedIn profile. Doesn't have to be
just for tech or developed focused
individuals.
Um, open with a strong
concise
sentence, right? So, who you are and
what you do with and and what you're
working toward exactly what I mentioned.
Um, an example
see um I am a front-end developer with a
background in visual visual design and a
passion for building intuitive user
experiences.
Use plain confident language.
Avoid buzzwords and filler
like I mentioned seasoned
junior
results driven
team oriented
let's
step forward with
bold
language
unique ways of describing or saying
those words right like a human, right?
Who understands their work, not a press
release or not writing press releases.
We'll save the press release for the
chief of staff at whatever organization
you all are at when you become the uh uh
chief technology officer.
Okay? Then some the chie then the chief
of staff will write a beautiful press
release about all of you joining the
company as a chief technology officer.
This is how we're manifesting.
Okay.
Any questions?
Okay.
Hope how are you? How you doing? Hi Leo.
All of this sound good?
>> Well, I'm doing good. You said not to
use buzzwords. We're not supposed to use
like um career driven or
teen player words like that.
>> I mean, I think that there are other
ways of stating that. And I and I think
that
digging into what those words are and
and those descriptors
really is what's going to resonate with
you. Like there are are the expectation
is yeah that you are career driven. The
expectation is that you are a team
player. That's basic. You don't have to
say it.
that all of that are things that you
talk about in your initial screen with
your recruiter.
>> I feel like you would be saying like
don't use the ones that have lost their
meaning because they've been overused so
much. Like if you can come up
>> a little bit of that. Yeah.
>> Yeah. Okay.
>> It's a little bit of that.
Um
let me see you know highlight what you
build or solve right so mention
technologies you use problems you love
solving recent projects focus on
outcomes not just tasks what what have
you accomplished that resulted in
you know in um a
something that you what's resulted what
have you accomplished that has resulted
into something that you can show in data
like uh some sort of metrics or
percentage.
So th that's what we're looking for not
just um not just the tasks that you've
done. Oh well, I joined Joy of Coding
and I, you know, worked on this real
project. Okay, but what did you solve?
What problem did you solve? And how did
you make a difference? Add a personal
human touch, a line about how you think,
what drives you, or why tech excites you
and and helps make your summary
memorable and real. talk about the
contribution that tech does for you and
the masses, right? Um, so here are some
examples and I feel like that's always
um the best way to to kind of talk about
these things. So, here is an early
career uh front-end developer um summary
and and you know someone who has been
making a uh who is making a career
switch.
Um I'm a front-end developer with a
background in architecture and a growing
passion for building responsive
accessible web experiences. I specialize
in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and
recently completed a React focused boot
camp where I built a task a task managed
app with real time form validation.
Before transitioning into tech, I
managed crossdisciplinary
design projects and collaborated with
engineers, clients, and city agencies
with which taught me how to communicate
clearly and think in systems. I am
currently diving deeper into Typescript
accessibility best practices and
testdriven development. I love clean
design, collaborative code, and solving
the kind of problems that make life a
little easier for users.
What are your thoughts on that?
Anyone?
>> I like it. Uh I What were you going to
say? It's not good.
>> No, I'm using as an example.
>> Okay. Yeah. No, I thought it it was very
straightforward. Uh makes you feel like
the person's
really representing themsel uh you know
you um what's the word? Can't think of
the word I'm thinking of. But uh that
they're they're being genuine basically.
Do you know what I mean?
>> Sure. And it absolutely it's it's it's
describing
where they are, where they've been, and
where they want to go.
Does anyone else
have any thoughts? Kai, what about you?
This was this was inspired by you.
>> You are my inspiration.
>> I appreciate that. I would love to be
your muse. Um
I I think that it sounds good. Uh
the areas that I am unsure about just is
how much of a sort of listing out like
softwares that I use as part of that
initial statement. Is that something
that is beneficial
or is that something that is covered
elsewhere?
>> It it is uh you know if we're talking
from a LinkedIn perspective, it is
covered in the skills that you list in
each job section.
And now keeping in mind that LinkedIn
always keep in the back of your mind
that the entire profile is searchable.
So that's why you know you can put some
of your programming languages and
frameworks if if applicable in the
summary. if that is how you would like
to represent yourself, there's certainly
no reason why you you can't or you
shouldn't.
And again, we're just talking
specifically about LinkedIn.
So it it is definitely a way that you
can um present yourself and I think it
is a good way to present yourself if you
are
trying to say that you are more junior
without saying that you're more junior.
Does that make sense?
>> Yeah. Yep. Absolutely.
that is how do you how do you sort of
blend that sort of balance though with
the you know senior experience you know
maybe in the project management side of
things at least specifically for me with
the junior
level of experience within the field
that I'm applying into.
Well, I mean you're the only reason keep
this in mind everyone your junior
because number one that's the title that
is your title here
at at TechJoy Academy that that's
legitimately what your title is. Okay.
And then number two
you're this is new to you. This is
something that you are learning now and
you are will be a graduate of an academy
where you will have a certification in a
field that is new to you. But as
individuals,
you're you know not,
you know, in your, you know, you're not
super young coming out of school. I know
that there are um folks in the program
that by age are um younger and there are
uh different people here from all walks
of life. But that's what makes this
academy so beautiful and what's going on
here is it is a a safe to fail
environment where you are learning
something that is not just going to
benefit you as
uh someone making a career shift but
also uh thousands and thousands and
thousands of people that you are going
to be helping through the positions that
you will land at these uh various types
of companies.
So
you
aren't, you know, it's not like, oh, I
don't, you know, I'm just I'm so junior.
You you you
have tons and tons to offer. And again,
the full scope of your LinkedIn profile,
the full scope of your resume,
everything that you are arming
recruiters and hiring managers and
applicant tracking systems with,
you want to make sure that everything is
searchable, everyone can find you.
Now, there are a few other examples that
I have. There's one that's a little bit
um more of a midlevel
type of um uh developer. I am a full
stack developer developer
uh with uh
let's say with experience building
internal tools and customerf facing
platforms in startup environments. My
background is in product design. So, I
bring a user centered approach to
everything I code. Whether I'm building
APIs, shaping back-end architecture, or
refactoring a messy UI, I've worked in
small teams where adaptability and
ownership matter. And I'm especially
comfortable collaborating with designers
and project managers to turn ambiguous
ideas into shipped features.
Outside of work, I mentor early career
developers and occasionally write about
web performance and component design,
adding a little bit of what that person
does on the side outside of their sort
of nine-to-five because it does align
with the work that they do.
Same with me. I'm a recruiter. I recruit
for all sorts of positions within
different um uh capabilities and
different organizations from purpose-
driven healthcare uh general advertising
tech
uh
AI as well I will be shifting into but I
will be twe tweaking my summary a little
bit to reflect
that I not only recruit, but I am also a
career coach at a coding academy. So,
it's those sort of things that are
aligning with what I do,
right?
How does that sound? Does this make
sense?
Hello. anybody.
>> Okay.
>> Well, that's why I keep jumping in. I
keep jumping in because I feel bad
nobody's answering. I don't want to be
the only one answering.
>> It's okay. Some people, you know what?
They're just like sitting back, taking
notes, uh, digesting.
Um,
I
you know what, Kai? I
this session was more to kind of talk
about the
what we are actually going to be doing
in the evening portion. So in the
evening yes I will be sharing my screen
with some examples
of uh some software engineers full stack
engineers and we will be constructing
our um our summaries in um breakout
sessions in groups.
Ah you're putting a baby to sleep.
That sounds wonderful.
Um,
so
you know when you
when you build your summary,
it's you know line one is
really talking about who you are and
what you're currently doing.
I am job title or role with a background
in relevant area and a focus on skill or
a goal.
Line two to four talk about your work
skills, values, current learning
journey.
And then you know line five is sort of
optional.
what you're open to or excited about.
And this is a suggestion. You can kind
of make things a little bit longer.
Doesn't have to be like, oh, it's this
is my first line. Um, it's this is just
a little bit of an outline, right? So,
between now and our next session,
I encourage you to jot down two to three
sentences uh before the next session.
Um bring your draft or bullet points to
the workshop.
um because we will be doing some live
live drafting and peer feedback. So
there will be an opportunity to be in
different groups and and to
read and share your summary, you know,
and giving feedback about what stands
out, what could be clearer. And you
know, this is the sweet spot. This is
the time where you can sit and
collaborate with people that you trust,
people that are in the same position
that you are in the program and ready to
dig in to applying if you haven't
already. And we're we're all in the same
place, right? You're all in the same
boat. you've gone through and
participated in this incredible
um career academy and and coding
academy. You've been able to work with
some amazing people. I mean, Dr. Emily
um in and of herself is, you know, such
an invaluable resource.
And you've got some really amazing
coaches as well outside of me as a
career coach. you've such a great
support. But in these sessions with
myself, I encourage you to collaborate
with other people
um other students to see what they what
their approach is.
I mean, this is a part so much of what
you're going to be doing in in real time
in other positions that you land,
collaborating with with your team. And
then not just collaborating with your
immediate development team, but you
know, project managers,
designers of all kinds, uh, account
services, you know, it it really depends
on where you're going to land. And you
could be landing
in a variety of different places.
So use this opportunity to collaborate
with your peers as
what you're going to be doing in the
role that you're going to land.
Friends, what do you got for me?
We have 10 We've got 10 minutes.
I want to hear from you. Except for Kai
because he's
>> putting a baby to sleep.
>> I'm gonna try and
>> Okay,
>> this is not good. Uh,
do you need to present
sort of all of yourself in a sense? I
feel like sometimes
I feel like I want to only share
a certain section or version of myself
to the career audience
because I feel like that's
like they really only want to know a
certain amount of information and the
other stuff is not important.
However you wish to represent yourself.
>> Okay.
>> Yeah. Yeah. I mean I am really just
giving options. It it's about how you
want and feel the best way is to present
your best self.
And and all of these, you know, were
pretty focused. Uh the examples that I
gave you
were
focused on, you know, where you where
this person is,
what they specialize in, and
what they can bring to the table.
Highlighting
the hard and soft skills
is a great idea
if you're going for a low code position.
But you still want to make sure that
folks uh realize in your summary like I
am currently a BA at Microsoft.
I have a passion for full stack
development
and I love I really enjoy
learning
about code can write that because you
know what that is relevant and I mean
you all can tell me if I'm incorrect but
it it seems to me that
even if you are a low code focused
professional
that understanding and
having the ability and the desire to
learn more of that
backend or full stack development only
makes you more desirable.
So stating that there's nothing wrong
with that.
Yeah,
>> Katrina has a question in the chat.
>> Oh, thank you. What if you have
conflicting roles that you want to try
for, like game producer versus training
manager?
[Music]
You know what, Katrina? I'm gonna get
back to you on that because you know
what
game I need to I think that
I think I need to kind of dig in a
little bit and understand what a game
producer does.
>> That's okay. You don't need to you don't
need to super focus on it. It just it's
something that like um just trying to to
put it out there for for it. Like I I
know that there's two roles that I that
I've been looking into in the past and
and one is uh you know game producing.
The other one is is kind of training
management and I'm I'm definitely in the
training manager role now. Uh and I'm
loving it and I'm thriving in it and I'm
doing fantastic with it. Um
>> yep. and uh and kind of it it's kind of
the same but leading projects and making
sure everybody has what they need. It's
like the game producer is what I do for
React Jam. Um and making sure that
everybody has what they need, making
sure that everybody has a role and that
they have a task and and that I kind of
push things forward that way. So, it's
very very similar in that aspect,
>> but I'd be looking at two different
types of companies and two different
like I'd be focusing on two different
things. uh and I'm sure that there's
crossovers with that with other uh with
other like do I go software engineer, do
I go back full stack, do I go backend
engineer, like h how do you how do you
decide or
like I've had commentary on my LinkedIn
before that I'm too broad, but that's
because I was I was trying to cast a
wide net because I have many interests,
but that that can backfire. Um, and I I
wanted your your input on that.
>> Yeah. I mean personally I
feel like
stating something like I am a full stack
developer with
um a passion for gaming and
operations focused because really a
training manager falls in any
organization that's in the operations
department.
It would almost be
um you could be um on like the talent
side like the talent acquisition side of
things like talent operations. Um and I
know that there is a way of being
specific but covering everything. Who
told you that your approach was too
vague on LinkedIn? Curious.
because it's not supposed to be like
>> a variety of people actually. It was a
like um there were a couple different
times that I was told that I needed to
narrow my focus. I I was a bit too
broad. Um I have it more narrowed now to
where it's a bit more focused as to uh
my skills and and my my my skill set.
Uh, it could have just been a
um
an
>> interested if it was a hiring manager
that you spoke to about a position or
Yeah, because I mean we'll talk to me
about those things,
>> right? They don't talk to me at all.
>> Exactly.
Not yet. Not yet.
um you know because your LinkedIn
profile is exactly that and the summary
section it's a summary of what you're
looking for and you're supposed to cast
a wide net because a lot of times too
even though you're graduating with a
certain degree or a certain
certification
there are a multitude of organizations
and directions hopefully that you can go
into. The idea is to have options and
the idea is to get noticed by as many
people as possible.
It so I I just I don't know. I just find
that comment very interesting.
I I understand that there has to be some
level of specificity,
but at the same time,
if you're open to various opportunities,
there's no harm in listing that in your
summary of where your focus has been or
where you see yourself.
Thank you for for talking about that.
And John, thank you for drawing my
attention to the comments. I get very
focused on on all of you. Um, where do I
focus on one at a time?
Okay. Um, who else has questions,
concerns, thoughts?
Was this helpful for you today?
Yeah, John is nodding his head. So, I'm
going to I'm gonna I'm gonna believe
him.
So, if if
all of you have the opportunity to come
to the 6 PM session, I will be reviewing
everything that we went over, but the
bulk of it is going to be writing three
different versions of your summary. So
if you all have a head, if you all feel
that you have an opportunity to come
with uh versions of your summary, do not
change what is on LinkedIn now. Don't
because we want to see the before and
after. And the reason why I'm saying
come with two to three different
versions is so that you can discuss
these versions and edit these versions
with your peers.
and and have you know discussions.
>> I especially liked the second one that
you did two of them I believe only right
and the second one we didn't really talk
about but I really liked that one and
and I'm not saying I would take it
exactly but like is there a way uh you
could send it to me or somewhere I could
see it so I could pick some of the
things out of it.
>> Okay.
>> Yep. I like that second one even better
than
>> Yeah, it was, you know, different. Um,
and you know there I have uh other um
examples as well that I will try to show
and I'm going to pull um different uh
profiles
uh to sort of serve as an example and
see what others are of all levels
>> see what they're what they're noting. So
>> everyone,
>> thank you. Have a wonderful day and I
will be
>> seeing all of you at 6 if
>> if you're able.
>> Thank you. Thank you. I'll be back.
>> Bye everyone.
>> Bye bye.
