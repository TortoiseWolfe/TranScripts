https://youtu.be/Pm4wnFZZ_zk

What's up, Glenn?
>> Got it.
>> Nobody's spoken yet. So,
>> my uh team of for the weekly challenge
is in a meeting right now. I just snuck
out to come to this.
So
>> they keep you busy with that, don't
they?
>> Yeah, I know. It's crazy. So
>> yeah,
>> technically I can do as much as I want,
but you kind of just get sucked in more
and more, especially when people need
help. So
>> yeah. Yeah. So I guess there's an
advantage of working full-time.
[Music]
>> Yeah.
>> So
>> Well, I like when I'm learning
something. It's a little less fun when
you're only teaching and not, you know,
sometimes sometimes teach. Yeah,
sometimes teaching does help you learn.
>> No, it definitely does. Yeah.
>> But then after a while it sometimes it's
just like repetitive, you know. So
>> if it's the same thing over and
>> Yeah, I could see that.
My wife is asking me what what job did
you did you get asked about? I don't
remember the company name. That's how
bad that is. I don't remember the
company name cuz I
>> Which one?
>> The The one that uh you know I I just
kind of I put in an application on a
whim and then they called me back that
afternoon. This afternoon. So
>> yeah. What was it?
>> Uh that's what I'm trying to remember. I
have to have to find
the the email cuz um
>> So you got an you got an interview for
sure. Well, not well, I have to I have
to clean up my my my
resume some and then um yeah, once I do
that, they're going to he's going to
submit it to the team and I'm scared to
death of the stupid um the um tech tech
interview because I don't know if I'll
pass that or not, you know? It's like so
>> yeah, I'm a little bit concerned about
those too.
>> Yeah,
>> I'm trying to find ones that don't have
a tech interview.
Yeah.
>> Or try to impress them in other ways.
>> Yeah. I can't find the stupid email that
they sent me.
Where did it go?
>> Hey, Rodrigo.
>> Oh, hello. Hi, John. Hi, Glenn.
>> Hey.
>> Hey. Chelsea hasn't spoken yet, so
she's obviously letting people in the
room though, so she's there.
>> I am here.
>> I was actually just looking up
Glenn's resume because he said I heard
him say,
>> "I have to clean up my resume."
>> Well, he wants the bullet points under
each of the job things. And apparently I
misspelled masters. I have a ma masters
again. I spelled it wrong.
>> Oh gosh. Wait. So he wants you to do
what?
>> Just to just to tidy up the the the um
the bullet points so that they're
aligned with what each career position I
had cuz right now they're all at the
bottom. He said it would be an easier
plan if uh easier read if I set it up to
where the bullet points kind of
corresponded with the jobs that I was
did. It's with um Janice
uh Janice International.
>> Bullet points. Okay. Yeah, I guess I'm
There are a lot of bullet points. So,
I'm
>> Yeah, he meant he meant the skill the
skills
>> the skills. They're all like at the
bottom and he wants me to see if I can
align them up with the different job
experience experiences I've had.
>> So,
[Music]
I sent you I redid your resume and I
>> Yeah, that's the one I submitted and
that that's the one I submitted.
So, but he he said on on the on the on
the on the U skill level, he said the
skills are there,
>> but I'd like to see them aligned up with
lined up with you the jobs you did. Like
my Java skills would be with my with my
Java job. My React skills would be the
the internship. So,
>> that's just that's just his his thing,
which is fine. I'll do what he wants
because, you know,
>> that's what I you know. Yeah.
>> No doubt. No doubt.
>> Okie dokie. Everyone, thank you for
taking the time to come. Uh,
turtle, I owe you the sheet which I will
send over to you that we discussed. Yes,
the the job hunt process sheet. Um, so
for sure,
>> do you need to record?
>> Do you need to hit record? I'm just
reminding you if you didn't already.
>> Oh, yeah. I know it usually starts
recording.
>> Oh, it it says recording.
>> Oh, no. It's recording. Yeah, it's
recording. So, cool. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
>> So, everyone is on screen today. Thank
you so much. I just want to quickly run
through sort of the method to my madness
here. Uh, okay. Um so I just wanted to
follow up on a situation that happened
in the earlier session. Um you know I
was asking folks to
you know put on their cameras. Someone
did not I removed him from the session
because and I realized that I may have
come off a bit harsh when I asked
folks to turn their camera on and then
removed this person. My intent wasn't to
single anyone out.
my but rather to reinforce an important
part of professional etiquette and I
feel that it's worth noting.
Um so
having
having your camera on is a part of what
your job will be if you are a fully
remote employee or if you are a hybrid
employee. So, in most work environments,
being visible on camera is expected
during meetings unless there's a
specific reason that you can't. Um, and
those reasons are valid for the most for
most of the the time. Um, so part of
what I'm trying to do in these sessions
is give you a realistic sense of what
those expectations look like so that
when you're in front of a future
employer, you'll feel confident,
confident, and prepared at the same
time.
I understand that everyone has different
comfort levels and there may be personal
reasons why having the camera on is
impossible at times. If that's the case
for you,
please just let me know before or at the
start of a session so I can understand
and support you in the best way I can. I
want these sessions to feel like a safe
and encouraging space for you to learn
and grow. And because it is a part of
the professional expectation,
I have seen people be reprimanded for
not having their their cameras on during
professional meetings and things like
that when you're at work. So that's why
I why I ask. Also, a lot of what we talk
about is engaging. So, I want to make
sure that everyone is able to
participate in the best way possible.
So,
that's that spiel
this evening. Yes, I saw turtle. Hold
on. Let me get my comments up. Body
language. Yep. Arms length webcam is
best. Yeah. Yeah. No, there's definitely
as John readjusts. It's okay. And John,
the one thing rule you are breaking is
that I do not see Piper, which is
unacceptable,
>> but that's okay. We'll talk about that
another day.
>> Um cuz you know she's I with the name
Piper, I'm sure she's probably precious.
So um this evening we are picking up
where uh we left off but just also doing
some review from session A that I had at
noon. So, building your network, and
this is something that really relates to
all of you that may be actively applying
to jobs. And I it's uh hi key. It is a
um point that uh Dr. Emily really wants
me to drive home because so many people
are starting to actively uh apply for
jobs. And this is where that job hunt
process sheet comes in.
Raising hands quickly, how many of you
are actively applying to jobs?
Okay. Yeah. There we go. We got we got
some peeps. We got people doing it. I
don't know why.
>> I'll say soon. I'm not doing
need to start soon. I'm doing the pro
the next week or two.
>> I love it. I love it. I love it.
>> I I have a
>> You should get some time on the
calendar, too, John.
>> Yes.
>> Uh so I've been filling mine out. Um but
I don't know how to share it with you or
am I supposed to be sharing it with you
or just for my own? Is it just for my
own sake?
>> I Yeah, I'd like to see it. Yeah, you
can share it with me like uh uh create a
link
>> uh you know in the Google sheet. Create
the link
>> and then send it to me and just make
sure that I can view it,
>> share it first so that it can be viewed.
>> Um and then
>> we can the link.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Um Dan, that's great.
Uh but I'm not for social in the
program, but I reply when someone
reaches out to me with an appropriate
job. Beautiful. Beautiful. Um and
turtle. Yes. Like
>> when they reach out to me, the
recruiters, when they reach out to me
first, I'm always worried they're a
scammer.
>> Yeah. you you it's you you gota
uh you've got to try to sus it out. I I
get a lot of scams myself, but
researching I would first look the
recruiter up, see if they have a
LinkedIn profile that doesn't look AI
generated.
Research the companies that they're at.
Making sure that they are actually real
companies. So, doing a little bit of
research is going to go a long way.
Um, and and you know what, uh, Turtle,
you and I can go through that when we
have our one-on-one. So, um, let's try
to I I've got some time tomorrow if you
do, and if you do, um, if you wouldn't
mind, uh, sending me a private message
in Discord with your availability, I'll
throw some time on our calendars.
So
the network this is important okay it's
over the past six let's rewind
over the past six weeks we have been uh
we've been building a strong foundation
using LinkedIn in our job search so
let's do a really quick recap uh about
that journey so week one why LinkedIn
matters its role in today's job search.
That is what we covered in week one.
Week two, we covered the profile basics,
photo, headline, banner, contact
information, headline curation, and what
makes them stand out.
Week three,
we started crafting a compelling
summary.
Week four,
we were showcasing skills, projects, and
education.
Week five, last week, we were doing some
custom LinkedIn URL and contact
settings.
And then, of course, we've got week six,
building your network, and that is this
week. So, we've built
the storefront of your professional
presence.
Now, it's time to open doors.
And that's where networking comes in.
So, over the next two weeks, so this
week and next, we'll focus on who to
connect with and how to do it in a way
that feels authentic and effective.
Cool.
All right. All right.
So,
why networking matters?
Application alone are slow
and networking speeds up interviews and
opens doors. People hire people that
they know or that they're familiar with,
have a rapport with, or those referred
by trusted contacts. So networking is a
skill. It can be learned, practiced, and
improved. And there is a framework that
I'd like to highlight to help you with
this.
Let me actually put this in the chat
so that you can have this to work off
of.
Okay.
So, think of the fruit pair, okay?
Peers, employers, alumni, and relevant
communities.
Peers, developers who are a step ahead
of you or at other companies that you
are really excited to work with. Maybe
they're companies that are uh reaching
out to you. Uh Dan, Glenn, Turtle, to
your point,
um you know, sometimes you don't know
who these companies are and who is uh
reaching out to you, but that's one way
to find out. start reaching out to some
of the employees, some of the
developers, ask letting them know, hey,
I'm really interested in this company. I
am really uh I'm a fan of your work and
the work being curated and crafted by
your company. Um, you know, what would
you be open to connecting
or something simple? Thank you for the
ad on LinkedIn.
Employers, hiring managers, recruiters
at any of your target companies, or more
importantly, when you apply to a job,
a lot of times
the person who posted the job will be
listed. What should you do? Follow that
person.
Wait uh follow that person. When you can
follow, when you follow them, you are
able to message them.
That's when you message them your intro.
Attach your resume. Just applied to this
position. I'm very interested.
And make your pitch.
Totally. Feel free to write these
introductions that you're making for
yourself with these folks. um via IIA.
It's there to assist.
Now, yes.
Okay. Um alumni,
people from TechJoy. What about Miles? I
know he doesn't work here anymore,
but I've linked in with him. I've
connected with him. I've chatted with
him.
It's a way for me to establish a
relationship with Miles for all of you.
Miles is a working tech recruiter and he
has a lot of relationships. So staying
connected with Miles, reaching out to
him, checking in how he's doing,
it's it's an important part of uh of the
piece of this puzzle, right?
So you're able to continue conversations
and stay on the top of someone's list
and top of mind. And then of course
relevant communities. So, you know, uh
anyone that is maybe um
you could
reach out to a chief technology officer
to uh Key brought up actually an amazing
point in our last session in LinkedIn.
You can belong to various groups. within
those various groups are conversations,
posts, chats, listings of uh people that
you might want to work with. That's a
great opportunity for you to connect and
network with those people within those
groups.
So, that was a a a great point that Key
brought to light and something that all
of us should definitely think about.
Um now finding the right people
I
will first start in reiterating again
when you apply to a position
you send you press send you think you're
done
you're not done your next step or even
while crafting and curating your your
tailored resume for that job specific
job description to apply to that role.
Look up the company. Do a little bit of
research.
Go and look at the employees who are at
that company.
And if a recruiter or talent acquisition
or HR individual is not listed
in the job posting,
that means you search for those people.
What I'm seeing in the job hunt process
sheet is wonderful. Some of you have
quite a long list of companies that
you've been targeting, places that
you've been um applying to, and there
are a few different tabs, and I'll I'll
pull the sheet up uh in a bit.
But what I'm not I Oh, sorry. I'm seeing
a lot of
connections with other software
developers, maybe folks that seem like
hiring leads, but I don't see a lot of
connections with recruiters and talent
acquisition representatives. And they
are actually the most important people
to be connecting with. Why? Well,
they're the people that are recruiting
for the role actively. They are your
first touch point. They are posting the
job. They understand the specific
nuances
um within the brief within the job
description that the hiring lead is
looking for. He they also are aware of
what the job description doesn't say.
What are the nice to haves? what where
what organization or companies is the
hiring manager targeting? Most often
when I am reviewing a job description
uh or a job brief with a hiring lead
before I get a job posted or before I
start sourcing,
I my one of my first questions is what
company do you admire right now? What
are your top three? Because those top
three companies, I'm going to I'm going
to mine and and dig into those employees
and see who I can pull out from that
company.
See if I can gain any interest.
I will
in
in uh I will parallel path also looking
at applicants
but most recruiters will first look at
referrals
second they will well they're looking at
referrals they'll also source on
LinkedIn. I look at applications
toward the end to be honest.
It's not my first priority.
So
you have to make yourself a priority and
highlight yourself to them. And that's
another critical reason why reaching out
to multiple people within the
organization is going to help you and
not hurt you. But the recruiter or
talent acquisition team should be the
first touch point. Now, if you don't see
anyone with the title that says
recruiter or talent acquisition,
that recruiter could be an HR
generalist. So, look for someone that
has a title in HR. And if that's not the
case, there is a recruiter and maybe
it's a strange title,
the HR representative will get your
resume and information over to the right
person. They always do. They're HR. They
do the right thing.
So that's touch point number one.
Another tool that I might use is the
alumni tool.
And it is LinkedIn's most powerful
networking feature. And it doesn't have
to be just for, you know, alumni to of
folks that were with you or before you
at TechJoy Academy, but it could be
folks that you've worked with in the
past. It could be um
you know people that you did go to
university with if your degree is
relevant to the job that you are looking
for or maybe there are folks that um
graduated from your university that
ended up going to Microsoft or Google or
you know Spotify or you know wherever
you're targeting.
Now, I
will
run through those filters in a moment
and give you a little bit of a demo
search. But before I do that, when you
make contact with someone, so when you
identify who you would like to follow or
connect with, when you send that invite
to connect,
write something personal or personalize
it, the the note. Hi, I'm a fellow alum
from I went to Hunter College. So, I'm a
fellow uh I'm a fellow alum from Hunter
College building skills in uh low code
development. I noticed you're working at
Amazon, which is one of my favorite
companies. Would love to connect and
follow your journey. So, it's not
intrusive.
It's just stating, "Hey, I'd really like
to be in touch. I've been following your
work. I'm paying attention. I see that
we come from the same university and
you're doing things that I want to do.
I'm highly inspired.
I'd love to follow you on your journey.
That way, you can also see any, you
know, company updates that they might
make. Um, you can also,
um,
you know, a peer level alumni. So, you
know, hi Glenn, great to see another
TechJoy alum in uh you know, full stack
uh develop working as a full stack
developer at Amazon. Um I'm exploring
opportunities in this space and thought
it'd be great to connect.
Sweet, relaxed.
So the formula
it's what
we've been calling you know a personal
I've been calling it a personalization
formula. So
context plus relevance
plus a small ask
right.
Hi Kai, fellow TechJoy alum here. Saw
your work on this specific project.
Would love to connect and follow your
updates. Super simple.
And then when they do ex accept your
invite,
let them know.
Thanks for the ad.
I look forward to staying in touch.
All right. Can I put something in? Can
you show us a few of these HR title
examples on LinkedIn? I can try. We can
search at some com for some companies
and see what we can we can find. Um
on LinkedIn, free basic users can send
up to five personalized
connection requests with a note per
month.
Understood? And if you're focused and
actively applying for multiple jobs, I
would consider getting um LinkedIn
Premium
just so that you're able to send some of
those messages um you know more of them
because the basic LinkedIn is extremely
limiting.
All right. So, let us
let's take a look here and pull up
LinkedIn.
Do some searching.
Well, I'm getting this up and running.
Does anyone have any questions?
>> Yeah, I do.
>> So, uh I mentioned you that recruiter
that reached out to me from Laurian
Global Tech Recruiting.
>> Um and I sent my res I sent my resume
and I haven't heard back. Um, I didn't
know if there's like, you know, a
certain timeline like uh does it take
often like a week or so to get for them
to get back to you or do you think now
they're just not interested after he saw
my resume?
>> Well, I mean, they saw your LinkedIn
profile, so there has to be some
interest, right? But
>> yeah,
>> what commonly will occur is the
recruiter may find you your LinkedIn
profile interesting and ask for your
resume. The reason why they ask for your
resume is to share your resume with the
hiring managers.
>> Okay, so that might take
>> my question is
>> yeah, so let's do this. Let's look that
company up. Hold on. Let me share my
screen. Yeah, that was going to be my
next thing was they have a t I mean if
they're a global company, they got a I
mean they're global recruiting, but they
have a ton of recruiters on LinkedIn.
And I was going to say, is it like a
slap in the face to your recruiter if
you reach out to other recruiters in his
same company? Is that a no no?
>> Like no. Uh but it it it depends then
and let's kind of let's see exactly what
this company is. Can everyone see my
screen
>> that? Okay.
>> Uh what's the name of the company again?
John
>> Laurian. So L O R I A N.
>> Okay,
that's it.
Well, yeah. Laur,
but it's Laurian Global Tech Recruiting,
basically.
>> Okay. So, this is a recruitment firm.
>> Yeah.
>> Okay.
>> For tech.
>> Okay.
Florian.
>> Oh, you put in Florian. I'm sorry. It's
with an L.
>> I just changed it.
LinkedIn changed it.
>> L O R I A N.
>> Yeah. Uh like their website is Laurian
Global. Um, the technical name I think
was Laurian
House of Glo or Laurian Global House of
Tech Recruiting,
but I I don't know why yours wouldn't be
coming up. Should I give you the guy's
name?
>> Yeah.
>> Okay. So, this is a recruitment firm.
This will be a good exercise.
Yeah. I mean, I didn't realize that this
was for a recruitment firm when you
messaged me. So,
>> oh. Oh, wait. It It might be
Oh, I'm sorry. It's with an E. It's L O
R I E N. See if that makes it come up.
But I'm also going to give you the guy's
name.
>> Okay, let's see.
>> All right. Salesforce recruiter.
All right. That's weird. All right.
Let's just hit one of these.
>> His name was Lazaro. Lazaro C. His last
initial C. It just says Lazaro.
>> Yeah, that's so annoying. And that that.
Sorry, I'm being now, but it's so
annoying because it's like you're a
recruiter and you don't even put your
last name. Like,
>> yeah,
>> that's just unacceptable. You don't want
a recruiter in witness protection,
>> right?
>> Right. It's like, who are you? But you
know what? This is a good exercise
because
you know,
I was a recruiter. I I I cut my teeth in
recruiting from a staffing agency.
That's where I entered the game. Then I
moved on in-house working at staffing
agencies. And there's a lot that I loved
about staffing agencies as a recruiter.
There's probably even more that I that I
disliked.
Um, this kind of ambiguity is one thing
that I did not like. But, okay, here we
are. So, they are a staffing and
recruitment firm,
but they told you the client that they
were going to be sending your resume to,
correct?
>> Yeah. It's Bayer, who I guess,
>> okay,
>> is part partnered with Monsanto now, or
they bought him out or something.
>> Yes.
>> Literally,
>> literally a big office like 2 minutes
from me. Um, I didn't even
>> No.
>> So, I was like, I don't know if that be
Yeah.
>> Um, did they
So, you didn't did you speak with this
recruiter?
No, this has all been so far through
LinkedIn messaging, but he did put his
phone number, but I didn't call him. I
put like my phone number.
>> Yeah.
>> Um he did initially say that yeah, he'd
like to chat and look at my resume.
Well,
>> it was uh kind of the timing of it, like
I I ended up sending the resume last
Friday uh evening, so I knew like I did.
I mean, that's the soonest I could. And
uh
>> okay
>> I knew like the weekend. Yeah. So
>> so what's happening now John and
everyone just to to know what's
happening now is
um the recruiter who reached out to John
is gathering other resumes of other
people that he feels could be aligned
with whatever this role is.
He's gathering those resumes and then
will likely send those resumes over in
bulk, find out what the who the hiring
manager is interested in speaking with
and then John, if the hiring manager for
this role is interested in connecting
with you, then they the recruiter who
reached out to you will likely ask to
speak with
you you will discuss uh the distance
from the office uh any specifics about
the role and they will discuss salary as
well. I know that you gave me a salary
band and it was listed in the job
description that you shared. However,
they will want to speak with you um you
know about you know more specificity
around your uh the salary range that
you're looking for. Now, getting back to
the search. So, here we are. We're at
the Laurian page.
And here where it has employees, this is
what you're going to click because what
that will do is pull up a list of
everyone that is working there. And you
said, what was your recruiter's name?
>> Lazaro. L A Z A R O. And then he didn't
put his last name. It's just with a C.
Lazaro C.
>> Okay. Okay.
We don't have to
run through everything. However, I mean,
this is a little bit of a nuanced search
because this is a staffing agency
and it looks like they are likely
um they're within tech, but then of but
then it looks like they're within
healthcare, bare, different areas of
tech.
Mhm.
>> But
if you
John in this case, no, I would not I
would maybe connect
with different recruiters, invite them
to connect.
>> So that's actually what I meant.
My question uh then was going to be
can you can you just click the connect
button or is it crucial to put a message
with your connection if it's going to be
from to a recruiter or or anybody else?
Um, it it's not
it's not crucial that you send a note,
but I would,
>> okay?
>> Because everyone's just send without
note. That's what everybody does.
You want to let people know, hey, I'm
applying to said role or I just applied
to this role. If it's a recruiter uh or
someone that is in a recruiter or talent
acquisition position and this is
>> not for your situation, but when you're
applying to roles.
>> Yeah.
>> Um
that that is what I would do. And but in
your case, yes, sure, you can just
connect with them. You could send a note
saying, "I'm working with Lazaro. I
just, you know, wanted to connect so
that I could, you know, follow your
posts."
>> Because at staffing agencies, when a
recruiter works at a staffing agency,
they work on commission.
>> Yeah, I that's what I figured. So,
>> yeah. So if you reach out to another
recruiter, it can be a conflict of
interest, right?
>> Yeah, absolutely.
>> Um, but there's a lot of people here.
It's interesting because it just says
like LinkedIn member, nurse, but then
you have, you know, field engineers and
uh,
okay, so they're like all over the
country it looks like, unless they have
just people working. Um,
working remote.
Yeah, this is a this is a strange
situation because
>> company.
>> Well, not a strange company. It's just
sort of this when it just says LinkedIn
member. Oh, it's just like what does
that mean? Why is that here? But I mean,
it's legit. there are, you know, folks
that are connected through cyber
security and
analysts and, you know, it looks like
they are just a staffing firm that
covers tech. So,
>> yeah.
>> But what is another company that all of
you are applying to?
Does anyone want to throw out a company
name that I can research
and show you
>> what's digital? Oh,
>> go ahead. I was going to say Renstead
Digital.
>> Renstead Digital.
>> Yeah. R
D. I'll put I'll put it in the chat.
>> Isn't it Is that's a staffing firm? No.
>> I don't know.
>> Yeah, it is. Rand. We've got one of
those here.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah.
Yeah.
>> Rand logo's different.
>> Yeah. Rand is a staffing firm. Oh, okay.
Never mind. Never mind. My bad.
>> I've been curious about
>> you break I fix. He he won uh on Shark
Tank and seems to have gotten a pretty
good business out of it.
>> It's a individual or a company.
>> It's become a company. It's become a
chain. M
>> there they're a big catch is go in to
get the screen fixed on your phone and
it's usually cheaper just go ahead and
buy a uh subscription and then you
forget to cancel the subscription.
>> Okay.
>> Okay. Is that a a position that you've
been applying? Have you been applying to
positions at this company or
>> I've been thinking about it. That's kind
of why I wanted to research them. I
don't know if it would been necessarily
I don't know how much soft I don't know
how many software positions they have
open.
>> All right. Let's see if they do. What's
the name?
>> You break. I'll fix.
>> You break.
>> That's it.
>> There it is.
>> Is that the company that fixes phones
and screens?
>> That's their front door.
>> That's their milk and bread that gets
you down to the convenience store. But
what you actually do is get a
subscription that's like insurance on
your technical devices. So, I've had
them like uh do a factory re reinstall
or a factory reboot on devices I'm
locked out of. Like so, you know, got
one at a yard sale and didn't have the
password or whatever, they'll take it to
them as long as it's not as long as the
serial number don't show up as it's
stolen or whatever, they'll reset it for
you.
>> So, it's basically insurance up to like
5,000 a year, I think, for any of your
technical devices.
There's one developer here that perhaps
you could reach out to and and you know
uh see if they wouldn't mind connecting
so that you can follow them and and
follow anything that they're posting
about.
Um
it's like there's
>> I think as far as like we talk about
doing uh like low code just to get like
get your foot in the
>> Yeah. in the industry because they're
they're really working on hardware, but
>> I can see that, you know, that hardware
is where I'm weak at. If I'm doing a
virtual server, I'd kind of like to know
a little bit more about the specs of
what the physical server needs to be to
match that in a virtual server, I guess.
I don't know.
>> Sure. Sure.
Um,
uh, Kai, what about you? Are you
applying to any positions right now? Any
companies you want to look and see if we
can find some talent acquisition folks?
>> Airbnb.
>> Okay.
Can I spot them? Yeah. Here we go. All
right. Yeah, these will be some good
folks. So,
let's check it out. So, we go to the com
Look up the company. Go to the company.
I would follow the company if that's you
know somewhere you're interested in
working and then
check out the uh employee the employees
that they have there.
So straight away, senior technical
recruiter,
I would say connect with that person.
Senior recruiter, Airbnb, connect with
that person.
>> Should I look at there are
>> people that are
>> Yeah.
>> Should I look at people that are in like
the office a specific office location or
does it does that not matter?
Um, I don't. It really depends on the
role that you're applying to and what it
states in the job description. If it
states in the job description that it is
remote, 100% remote, then you can, you
know, reach out to multiple recruiters
and let them know that you applied to
this role. I'm very interested in this
position and you know uh ask to connect
attach your resume.
If it states that you have to be located
in a certain area then you will
need to
be more specific and search for a
recruiter that may be in that area. or
you can just cast a wide net and reach
out to one or two recruiters.
Um
but you you can also see that there are
you know creatives
tech
um there are probably analysts like low
code practices in here
but uh senior software engineer and you
can just you know click to follow or
connect with these these people
and you know sometimes you can just
connect with
uh the employees outside of of HR and
recruitment and say, "I'm interested in
staying in touch." Something simple.
Doesn't have to be complicated. Keep it
simple.
Yeah. There's a lot of of creatives.
Is is there a way to tell what
recruiters
are generally recruiting for? I mean, in
big companies like this, I'm assuming
certain recruiters are recruiting for
specific areas like engineering or
marketing or
>> uh it'll say marketing recruiter. I
think we just saw one that said
marketing recruiter, I thought.
Um
but most of the time if they're
recruiting
engineers or
you know front lo front front end or
like low code full stack it'll just say
tech recruiter.
>> Okay.
>> Yeah.
>> Thanks. And if it's creative, it'll say
it might not say creative recruiter, but
you'll
it won't say tech.
Sometimes um you know, if it's more of a
goto market role, it'll say GTM
recruiter.
It'll say executive if they're
recruiting for more seuite managing
director level folks.
it will say corporate recruiter if
they're focusing on um client services
new business. This uh Britney here just
says recruiting at Airbnb, but sometimes
I can tell what they're recruiting for
depending on their background. Let me
see.
She's in New York New York. Oh,
interesting. She's got a pro a profile
or a portfolio link or a personal link.
That's interesting. What's going on
here? Okay. Here we go. Ah, okay. Yeah.
So, you can see she focuses on UX, UI,
product design, experience design.
Yep. And it says here, senior design and
creative recruiter.
>> Awesome.
>> So, looking at their looking a little
bit deeper into where they've worked and
their uh previous titles that
that usually works.
Um, good. Any other questions
about these searches?
Sometimes too what you could do
is how did I do that? No, I didn't do
more.
Are there any statements or comments or
notes that you can make that
encourage a follow-up
more so than others? Like if you want to
drop a note that's going to actually get
them to want to respond,
what does that look like? Like is there
any note that you get that you're just
like, h I'm going to I'm going to get
back to this person or is it really just
business matter of fact?
>> It's
it's not about being business or matter
of fact or even the contents of the
note. It's like, do you
have what I need? Are you that person?
>> Okay.
>> It's really about
>> if you need to tell them that.
>> If you need to tell them that, they're I
mean, a recruiter should know by looking
at your LinkedIn profile and the resume
that you attach. If they can't tell from
that, then you know they're not maybe
they're not as advanced as they need to
be. Like throwing me into a
senior level tech recruiter position,
I'd struggle for a few months because I
hadn't been in that world recruiting.
where I can hit the ground running and
take off without any training is within
a creative environment. So any kind of
like art, copy, design,
uh UX, UI, uh some analytics positions,
any kind of corporate roles, but tech is
something that I'm getting into in terms
of recruiting.
So
becomes a little bit, you know, you have
it. It tech is vast and the thing with
tech is it changes every single day.
>> Thank you,
>> Janice. All right, Glenn said Janice
International J. All right, let's see. I
don't know what that
there it is.
Wholesale building materials in Georgia.
All right, let's see.
>> Can't see your screen because you're
sharing it.
>> Oh, sorry. Stop sharing.
There we go.
Okay.
Oh, what kind of jobs do they have?
Let's see.
Okay. All right.
So, they've got developer stuff. They've
got what looks like uh they both have
low code and full stack jobs.
Cool.
And let's go to some of these employees.
>> Some of them look beyond my
>> Is this for your interviewing Glenn?
>> That that recruiter was calling about
this. Yeah, I was calling about Janice
International. Um
>> Okay. Okay. Very cool. Well, we've got
human resources professional here
and we've got a technical
>> How did you get there? I'm sorry. How
did you get there? Because I was trying
to do the same thing. I wasn't able to
get there.
>> Yep. So,
I went to the company.
>> Uhhuh.
>> And then I looked for the employees that
are working there.
>> I looked Okay. I looked at people on the
people link. It didn't go there. Okay. I
know that now. Okay.
>> Yeah. No, it's up here where it lists
all of the individuals.
>> Okay.
>> So, you've got this human resources and
then you've got Megan. Megan, right?
She's hiring. Do you remember who
reached out to you?
>> Yeah. Um, Pierce Ambus, but that was
with the recruiting company. It wasn't
with wasn't directly from these folks.
>> Ah, it's a recruitment firm. Gotcha.
>> Yeah. Yeah. So disappointed to find that
out, but oh well, that's how it goes.
>> Uh yeah, but even so, um
you can still
connect with people
>> and it can be simple. I look forward to
staying in touch.
Simple.
>> I got a quick question about Yeah. the
when you see over 100 people clicked
apply,
what is that like on your side of
things?
>> Uh, hell on earth.
>> Um,
>> cuz everything I see more or less says
over 100 clicked apply. And then what I
find confusing is then I'll see that
same job and they'll say reposted,
you know, like it's been reposted again
three weeks later or something, which
tells me either they did not get the
people that they wanted or
>> I don't know, maybe they just want a
bigger
>> group to choose from,
>> a bigger pool.
>> Yeah,
>> it could be could be all of that. It's a
multitude of things, you know. Um, also
something very annoying that occurs with
LinkedIn as a recruiter.
Um, when you post a job
on LinkedIn
and when you fill that role
and you remove
the post from LinkedIn,
it seems to never go away.
So while some jobs can say
actively recruiting a 100 people
applied,
it could also mean the role is actually
been filled and LinkedIn hasn't taken it
down.
I've had that happen to me uh a lot when
I was posting jobs.
>> Okay.
>> Um yeah.
Uh Dan.
Yeah.
>> Is is the reason for that because
LinkedIn is just trying to
>> show that it has more jobs and maybe it
really does or
>> No, it's just how it was explained to be
by some of the people that I know at
LinkedIn is it's just kind of like a
glitch. It doesn't
it it doesn't leave the platform
sometimes for months.
That's not every job, but it does occur.
>> Now, I
would look for jobs if you can that have
been posted
um that have been posted within the past
24 hours.
if you still feel passionate about
applying to the roles that
um 100 plus people
applied to. I would apply still apply to
the role
>> if you feel passionate about it, but
make sure you send a note to the
recruiter. Hey, I'm really interested in
this role. I see that over a hundred
applicants have applied. Is this role
still active for you? If so, I'm very
interested. If not, attached is my
resume. Please keep me in mind for other
positions like this coming down the
road.
>> It's still a connection.
>> Do recruiters still do sort of
informational interviews?
>> Yes.
>> Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So to answer someone's
>> always
I I did
>> but I'm a different recruiter.
>> I'm not lazy.
Um, a lot of recruiters are now a lot of
recruiters are stretched as well,
especially right now. And I think
someone was asking about to answer the
question or made a statement about Oh,
here
>> but Dan mentioned it. Some companies
will bypass a headunting agency and
direct hire for a permanent position,
but you could burn a bridge that way if
Yes. But so here,
companies that have the money to bring
in recruiters who are non-billable
to scope
to actively recruit for their positions,
they will not use staffing agencies.
There's no reason to because staffing
agencies charge you a markup.
It does not come out of a person's rate
or a salary,
but it is a markup.
Recruiters in-house will use and partner
with recruitment firms if they are
completely buried and some of these tech
companies have a ton of positions. I
would fight it personally. Um, and I was
also when I did bring uh on uh staffing
agencies to partner with, I was very
strategic about it because it it's very
sometimes staffing agencies can be uh
unethical
sending resumes
uh to uh companies to consider without
the candidates's consent.
which means that if the recruiter
in-house
reaches out to you,
they can't engage you. They have to go
through the external staffing agency
because that's like a little recruiter
law.
So, it can get complicated.
I'm I definitely utilize
these these people, but
um don't be afraid to work with them.
Just do the research. I am looking for
really quickly because I know that we're
at time, but I want to show you very
quickly the the sheet that I was
referring to and it will take me
anymore.
Ah, here it is.
Okay, here's the process dock.
Here we go.
Okay, can you all see this sheet?
Yeah.
So what is important
to really focus on listing your job
applications. So the link, the company,
the position, the date you applied,
following up with the actions. So you
applied, not moving forward, waiting for
a response, interviewing, and all this
shifts, right? Because you're monitoring
the progress. If you're interviewing,
what's the interview date? What's the
outcome? What's the, you know, where's
the location? Is it hybrid? Is it
remote? Any kind of notes that you can
add?
Now, here's the second piece. So, you've
applied. Awesome.
LinkedIn reachouts. Who did you reach
out to?
Then the link LinkedIn that you
the link to the person's profile that
you engaged
name of the person company
do they have openings
number of connections that you made
>> I didn't even see that page
>> yeah I don't think a lot of people How
do you hear that link
>> again?
>> How did I get there? The tab.
>> Yeah, from the other one.
Oh, okay. Extra details.
>> Where's Where's the link for this sheet?
I I've never even seen the sheet, let
alone that those tabs.
>> Uh, this is I Yeah, I don't It was sent
to me when I first started,
>> but that links right there.
Yeah, but um you have a link. You have a
Gmail account, right?
>> Yeah.
>> But I'm saying you could probably just
send the link in the address there in
the address bar.
>> Yeah, I can, but I need to make you a
viewer first and then in order for you
to edit it, you need to make a copy.
>> So, it's a couple of steps. No big deal.
>> But so, there's that. Now, here are some
things that I I would really like. um
all of you to think about and maybe just
um a little homework, right? So,
plan a twoe cadence.
Send an invite,
a thank you after acceptance, engage
with a post, ask for light advice.
If if if the engagement is nice, then
ask about the best way to be considered
for roles.
And that's how you do it.
And you know, I would
send 10 invites total by next week and
track it on your spreadsheet.
Who needs this spreadsheet?
Cut. Whoa. Okay, everybody.
>> I This is the first time I'm joining.
Um, but yeah.
>> Hi.
>> Okay. All right. Cool. So, let me know
make a note of this so that
Turtle needs it.
Pi needs it.
Glenn said he needed it.
Rodrigo,
Dan,
I think John has it. Yeah. All right.
Very good. I will get that over to all
of you.
Does anyone have any questions?
>> Uh, I had two. we can probably revisit
later. But probably more probably more
importantly, uh, don't forget we can use
AIA, too. I just asked Claude while I
was talking about like local mom and pop
shops
>> in my area that I may have overlooked.
>> And let me find their name here. There's
something called Build in Motion,
>> which I've never heard of, but it says
they specialize in mobile apps, AI
applications, e-commerce, directly
matching your skill set with React and
JavaScript. So, I want to go find out
who that is. Build in motion. here is
>> nice
>> cuz I was thinking like the big national
companies you know like those are very
competitive so basically I just asked
>> so on any of the AIS they've got the uh
the research where it kind of goes into
deeper thinking for a while it may be
limited if you're on the free accounts
but it does have that deeper research so
I just told it what city I was in what
distance I was willing to commute and
kind of let it I mean I'm sure it looked
through LinkedIn and Indeed and all that
stuff
>> nice I gave it the languages I have than
a couple things off my resume that I
want to specialize in it. What sounds
>> Yep. That's great. Perfect.
Any other questions? Yes. 10 invites
total by next week and track on sheet.
Yes, Kai.
>> Yes, Rodrigo. Sorry to interrupt you.
>> Oh, you're good. I I just wanted to know
if uh since this is the first time I
joined if I need to do anything that was
previously, you know, covered,
you know, in other sessions.
>> You might want to um watch some of those
sessions because I know that they're all
recorded.
>> Okay.
>> Yeah. And then um uh if you wouldn't
mind
messaging me directly
>> uh in uh actually you can respond to me
sending you the link
>> and maybe we should schedule time to
connect for 101.
>> That'd be great.
>> So we'll we'll get that. Yeah, we'll get
that on the calendar.
>> Um anything else from anyone? The only
thing I want to know is Kai, who is this
precious pumpkin
>> with the cheeks?
>> This is my daughter Navia.
>> She's just precious.
She is Oh my goodness. Things that I
would do that you're sick. That's no
fun.
>> Oh, the things I would do to those
cheeks. I don't even want to say.
O,
>> delicious.
>> Still has them. Isn't that right?
>> Still has those cheeks in there, but
they're gonna go away soon.
>> You're gonna You're going to stretch.
>> Going to get tall. She's She's 90 she
was 98th percentile for height.
>> And I was loving that.
>> Really?
>> But she's been demoted. Now she's 94th.
>> So,
>> okay, that's no big deal. That's all
right. If she decreased in size, but her
brain got bigger,
>> right?
>> That's more important.
>> Yeah.
>> All right. I'm Kai. I'm going to let you
be, Dad. I'm going to let all of you uh
have a wonderful evening. If there is
ever anything that you need from me, I
am here pretty much all day Monday to
Wednesday. Thursday and Friday I'm a
little bit off doing other things, but
if you message me in Discord, I'll look
at the end of each evening on Thursday
and Friday and over the weekend. Um,
yeah, thank you all for joining. It's
always good to see you. Bye, sweetheart.
>> Have a good evening, everyone.
>> You, too. Thank you.
