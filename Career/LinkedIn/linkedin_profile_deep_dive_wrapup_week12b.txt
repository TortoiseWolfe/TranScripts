LinkedIn Profile Deep Dive: Complete Profile Power & Wrap-Up (Week 14 Session B)
https://youtu.be/8vNK0CiXkOw

Hey Keith, how's it going?
>> Hey, I'm doing all right. How are you?
>> I am doing well. Um, I will wait just
one more minute. Um, I haven't really
had anyone. Last week, no one showed up.
So, I don't know what's going to be
going on now. But if it's just you, your
option, we, you know, totally up to you.
We can have the session or we can see if
people maybe show up tomorrow because my
time switched.
>> Uh, so I'm doing Tuesday, Wednesday
night. So, whatever you It's totally up
to you. You decide. So, I'll give it
until I was giving an giving it until
610,
6:15.
So, we'll see. Otherwise, I'm going to
uh let you decide what you want to do.
But I I have something, you know, I have
something planned, but either way, it's
totally fine.
>> Yeah. I know. Um last week, I had the
accountability check-in Wednesday night.
Nobody showed for that either. So, I
wonder what was happening last
Wednesday. Just nobody wanted last t was
it last Tuesday? Yeah, last Wednesday. I
just I don't know what was happening
last week.
>> Nobody wanted to show up for things. I
don't know.
>> Yeah. Well, I mean, it's getting to be
the fall, so people probably are kind of
like not really wanting to do much, just
like me. Hey, Anna, how are you?
>> Hello. Um, I haven't been over in this
stop in a while and I just figured let
me jump over here and see how it going.
>> Okay. Well, we're happy to have you. Um,
well, I will start. Um, this actually is
our 12 our week 12 wrapup series, which
should be exciting because I was going
to start moving more into resume
building and best practices. So, we'll
see how that goes. uh this session this
evening I am going to focus on the power
of a complete profile um because really
that's you know what we've been doing um
we've spent the last 11 weeks building
our LinkedIn presence from the ground up
and each week had a purpose and every
part connects to how recruiters find and
eval EV valuate you. So
we'll quickly walk through what we've
covered.
All right. So brief recap.
We have talked about why LinkedIn
matters. We've done the profile basics
and I believe both of you were, you
know, definitely in and out uh
consistently for these weeks. So you'll
remember or you can uh look at the the
recorded videos. Um but with with the
profile basics, we looked at everything
from the photo and headline banner. We
talked about com uh crafting a
compelling summary, highlighting skills,
projects, education,
um setting up and crafting our unique
custom URL and settings. We did part one
and part two of uh building your network
and one week we really talked about
connecting
um and sending invites. Second week for
part two we talked about keeping
relationships warm and authentic during
that networking process and that can be
over the course of several months and
really it never ends.
um messaging and outreach. We talked
about that. We also talked about asking
for and writing recommendations.
So, that's pretty important and
something that really has sort of that
timing component. Uh best utilized when
you are leaving a position, when someone
you worked with perhaps is leaving a
position to move on. Um or while you are
working with someone, say here in the
joy of coding, you had the opportunity
to work together on a project. Um ask
each other for uh recommendations, you
know, posting content and using
hashtags, learning that even those are
searchable uh for recruiters. And then
of course, job alerts, filters, and
search tools using boolean searches and
different ways of connecting with people
through groups and then just searching
for them through boolean searches. Um,
tonight we're going to start bringing
that all together. Uh, we'll focus on
making your profile fully optimized and
recruiter ready.
Now,
you know, from a recruiter's
perspective, really the goal is to help
all of you see how we recruiters
actually use LinkedIn to find a
candidate. So, it's nice to really have
me here as um you know, someone that you
can kind of lean on and ask these
questions. Um because most people also
don't really know what recruiting is and
how it works. Um recruiters use Blue
Lane searchers to filter candidates. We
talked talked about that quite a bit
over the past couple of weeks.
um profiles with complete information
rank higher in searches.
So if you don't have recommendations, if
you haven't been posting things, if you
know your skills aren't filled out for
each position you've worked, that
summary,
that headline, all is searchable. And
really, you know, the recruiters first
thing they see is the photo and the
headline. So, they really should be on
point. Um, engagement
and activity boosts visibility.
Commenting on posts, signing up to be in
groups, following folks in those groups,
you're able to network. It helps, you
know, allowing you to
um establish relationships, keep
relationships warm and authentic. So
it's really a plus especially during you
know these times where you're actively
applying for jobs should be again
following up with some sort of
networking after for folks that are at
that company that you've just applied.
Any questions, thoughts, concerns, or
just comments?
>> No. No, you covered a lot, but I haven't
been around, so I don't have much.
>> I Well, I just reviewed quite a bit. So,
you know, and then, of course, uh you
can refer to all of the recordings, so
it's all right there. Super easy to
access. So, no worries if you weren't
able to attend it live. This is why Dr.
Emily has designed the program this way,
so you always have these tools of
reference.
Um, so
we over the past couple of weeks and
this will be a great review for you Anna
and whoever
is looking to get it come in. Michelle,
let me say hello to her before I
continue. I don't know where she went.
All right,
continuing. So Anna, this will be a good
um review for you because what we were
talking about over the past couple of
weeks most specifically are boolean
searches and uh sort of sharing I'll
share with you now the type of Boolean
search that um that we use
to do searches or you know a a simple
example le so I'll put it in the chat
but this is an example of a more
technical search that um I myself has
used for a full stack developer just so
that you get an idea of what these
boolean search strings look like. The
quotes are purposeful
the parentheses as well. It is essential
uh that you utilize these searches, but
you as job seekers can also utilize
utilize boolean search methods. And if
you have no idea what that is, it's as
simple as going to Claude or chat GPT
and say
craft or write a boolean search for me
to put in LinkedIn to search for full
stack developer positions.
That's simple and easy to uh get you
started quickly as well. Um,
now
one question I would like to ask and and
I think you should constantly be
thinking about is what would make your
profile appear in that search that I
just
put in the chat.
If recruiters put this in their LinkedIn
search bar,
your all of your profiles should show up
if you are looking for full stack
developer opportunities, right?
>> So that's
>> I'm sorry.
>> I said it must be hashtags, right?
>> To make it
>> No,
>> no,
>> no. It's do you are you able to see what
I copy and pasted into the chat?
>> Yeah, but your question was what would
make our page appear
>> and so I was thinking that hashtags
would make it appear, right?
>> Um well it it's for the search in
general. So this and it's using this as
the example. So this boolean search
here. So if you'd look at your LinkedIn
profile,
the first thing maybe in the headline
should be full stack developer.
If
you know of course you know if you are
all looking for full stack developer
roles I think key we've talked kind of
extensively and and that would be a
position that you would be open to and
you know it says full stack developer or
software engineer because those they're
used interchangeably.
So, you know, maybe
as a clue, if you all are really trying
to position yourselves as a full stock
developer in your in your headline, you
can put full stock developer,
software engineer,
right? So, you could put those and then
your profiles would likely show up. But
also depending on what sort of database
or program knowledge you're really
focusing on, you might want to put those
in your headline too. But that and and
that will also make
this you come into come up in recruiter
searches also in skills, right? Skills
would be another way. Maybe you're
listing that you're at Java coding right
now and the skills if you are on the
full stack developer track you want to
make sure that those skills say full
stack developer software engineer and
maybe you know you're
feeling confident in JavaScript or
React. It's like this is coming up with
ways of making yourself visible on
LinkedIn for recruiters.
Okay,
so these key words, so skills, activity,
like yes, Michelle, you were close.
Like, yes, making a note in your
postings. Maybe you've posted an article
and the article was talking about full
stack development or React. You could
post the job and then put some hashtags
for that so that that comes up in a
search. It it does come up in recruiter
searches and they do help to make you
more visible.
So
now
for a profile deep dive, right? And and
this is still actually going to be a
review because we are finalizing our
LinkedIn series uh this week. The photo
and banner.
Is your image professional and clear?
Pull up your LinkedIn profiles. Look at
them now. And they should definitely be
up because we're going through this.
So, is your im is your image
professional and clear? Does your banner
represent your field?
The headline,
does it state your role,
specialty, or target position?
And the about section or summary,
take a look at that. Does it tell your
story clearly in two to three short
paragraphs?
This is this is what you think about.
This is what recruiters look at
experiencing projects. Are your projects
explained with outcomes or tools used?
That's critical. And again, Dr. Emily
has designed this program so that you
are working with real clients on real
projects
so that you have the opportunity to
fluently
provide
these projects. talk through these
projects and explain them with outcomes
in the tools that you've used. These are
stories that you can not only utilize
here in your LinkedIn profile,
but in your recruiter interviews and
technical interviews.
skills.
Are your top 10 skills relevant to the
jobs you're applying for?
Whether you are
full stack developer, software engineer,
or you're focusing more within low code
positions,
those skills need to be listed.
Recommendations.
Do you have at least one or two?
All right. So, what I would like you to
do right now is pick one section to
improve tonight
and update it.
It's 6:25.
I'll give you 10 minutes.
How's everyone doing?
I'm giving you until 6:35
and then we'll talk a little bit about
the changes that we made and maybe give
some examples if anyone is inclined.
>> Do you have to um have a paid
subscription to do hashtags on LinkedIn?
>> Oh. Uh-uh. No. You can make comments,
you know. Um, but I mean hashtags are
really only valuable if you're looking,
you know, if you're posting something,
maybe an article or a podcast
that you listen to that you want to
share that has to do with software
development, uh, you know, full stack
development, QA, whatever really your
your focus is, data analytics,
data visualization really, you know, I
would keep it professional, especially
on LinkedIn.
>> Yeah.
>> But
yeah, it should connect to something.
>> Yeah. Another lady just got fired for
doing something at a baseball game.
You got to be careful everywhere now.
Mhm.
Three more minutes everyone.
Hey everyone, we're going to start
wrapping up what you're doing.
And welcome Timothy. We just did a
review of what we've covered over the uh
past 11 weeks that I've been doing the
uh why LinkedIn matters series.
Um and
uh we just did a live edit of our
LinkedIn profile. So, over the past
several weeks, we have been talking
about things like our photo and banner.
Is your image professional and clear?
Does your banner represent your field?
And then moving on to the headline, does
it state your role, specialty, or target
position? All of this you should be
thinking about when looking at your
LinkedIn profile.
the summary or about section. Does it
tell your story clearly in two to three
short paragraphs?
And then moving down into the experience
in your projects that maybe you have
listed, which you should have listed.
Are your projects explained with
outcomes
or tools,
programs that you used?
Skills. Are your top 10 skills relevant
to the jobs that you're applying for?
Are they relevant to the jobs that you
previously worked for?
And then recommendations.
Do you have any at least one two?
So I asked folks to take 10 minutes and
pick one section to improve right now.
And now
common mistakes that folks make. Keyword
stuffing or vague summaries.
You want a little bit of you definitely
in these about sections.
It's about you and it selling you. And
if you're getting stuck,
type what you want to be said into a
claude or chat GBT or your AI platform
of choice.
Dr. Emily says this all the time. It's
about utilizing
these um new platforms. That's going to
give you the edge. Incomplete job
descriptions. This is a huge mistake to
avoid. There should be a lot in there
describing what the project was, how
many people partnered with you, what
your role was in these specific
projects,
how you solved the problem.
And then of course even better is to
have a personal portfolio that shows the
project, lists the people that were
working on the project and their duty so
that when a recruiter looks at it, they
know exactly what you did. You didn't
build the entire thing unless you did.
But if it's something here from uh
TechJoy, then you should be listing the
people that you worked with to
accomplish the project.
Um, neglecting a banner or a headline,
that's just a missed opportunity to not
be visible and not come up in uh
recruiter searches.
And if you're not engaging or posting
with LinkedIn, you're also not getting
everything out of it that you can. Every
section should work together to tell the
story of where you're headed next.
Questions,
thoughts, and concerns before I have
some of you show what you did.
Okay,
>> I will know where to start
>> with with what, Anna?
>> Uh, everything. Um, because I think the
last time I on your class was like a
couple months ago. So,
I had to start from scratch on this
stuff.
>> Yeah. And you know what? I just laid it
out. Super easy.
Start from the top.
You start from where? You tell me
>> the description under your picture. You
have photo and your banner there.
>> Uh f the the photo and the banner is
where you start.
So you look at the photo and the banner.
Does
your banner does your is your image
professional
and clear? And does your banner
represent your field?
>> Yes.
>> Okay.
So, so those are the questions that that
you should be asking yourself.
>> Let me do this. Let me put all of that
in the chat.
All right. And you know what? I'm going
to do a little snooping.
I'm going to look myself.
That's about the only thing that was
kind of done.
>> We're gonna we're going to go through
the whole lot.
>> But, um, who So, in the, uh, chat, I,
uh, listed what you should be thinking
about. Um, Anna stepped forward. Who
else would like to
talk about what they worked on?
And if nobody steps up, I'm going to
have to pick you.
>> Yeah.
>> Because eventually all of you are going
to go.
>> I can talk about what I updated.
>> Yeah.
>> Realistically, what I did right now was
not much. uh because I have been, you
know, following along as best I can and
um watching a couple replays for the
sessions that I did miss. Um so I had
just about everything pretty well
updated. I did a little bit more
updating now that I've kind of like
>> got a better understanding of like my
rules. So like I updated my heading to
to be more clear and not have as many
like filler words that meant nothing,
right?
Um, and then I updated like my about
section to be more like what my
passion's about more so than just here's
the tasks I did, right? Um, it's still
got a little bit of that like
>> the tasks I did, but a lot more passion
behind it. I think like the the phrasing
is a little bit more
>> personable rather than just like I did
A, B, and C.
Um,
>> yeah,
>> like you talked about image. That is the
biggest thing that I need to get my
image.
I'm not great at those. Like I already I
know I need a new like professional
image. Like I need a new like head shot
like taken. Um
>> and so that I need to get that that
updated. And I have not
gotten a banner that is like included in
the like text space like right like my
banner it's not it's just like an image
to put there.
>> Yeah. So I understand
>> to that. Um
>> I know I know it gets it gets difficult
for sure to do that. Um,
yeah. It and it's it's really honestly
it's just about
starting with at the top
>> and you take it day by day. You're like,
"Okay, you know what? Today I'm going to
I'm going to go through this first
initial square." So, we've got in this
first, you know,
where it has the headline, the photo,
your name, the title, your location,
your contact info. It's going through
every bit underneath your contact info.
I mean, it should have uh whatever your
LinkedIn profile, how you want that
listed. Um, some people list their phone
number. I don't do that. Um I
personally, especially if you're looking
for a job, your email address is
perfect.
Don't you don't need to list your phone
number. Um I I don't know. I'm just
as as much information that I can give
you so that you can at least get in
touch with me but not stop me. Mhm.
>> Um,
some recruiters would probably be like,
"Don't tell don't tell people that." But
private I mean, you know, it's just for
privacy and security reasons. I say
this, right? Not listing all of your
personal information. It's not needed,
but just take everything in stages. Did
you want to say something, Michelle?
>> Yeah. Um, is there yet invented, which I
probably am going to write it if it
hasn't been, is a a good email system
that can separate like all the stuff
comes in, right? It separates it to
business stuff and that, you know,
automatically it doesn't just all go
into the inbox and
your way to
>> I mean, I'm pretty sure that you can do
that with any email platform. Um, I know
you can do it with Outlook. Um, I
haven't done it myself with Gmail, but
um with Outlook, but I haven't figured
that out.
>> Yeah, you can you can do it, but you
probably have to look up on YouTube.
>> Yeah. Yeah, I would do that, Michelle.
But because Yeah, you can do that for
sure. I just I just don't know how. I
haven't I haven't done it in a while, so
I'd have to look at YouTube myself.
>> Yeah,
>> with you. with Outlook, yes, but not
with Gmail. Um, I know I know it pretty
fluidly.
>> Well, Gmail does have some auto
filtering you can do, but oftent times
it's not great. Um,
>> Oh, really?
>> Honestly, what has worked great for me,
which I would suggest if you're using
Gmail specifically, create another Gmail
account, right? have a like I have a
separate
>> like professional email where I'm
expecting
>> um like interview requests and responses
to job applications. I have a completely
separate email compared to like my
personal
>> like information and emails just because
it's a lot easier to to see
>> um without all this noise to see whether
somebody's requesting an interview.
>> Yeah, definitely. But I find because
I've been doing that some of the job
boards in the past I have put resumes
out on I still get junk from all of
I still do Zip Recruiter and some of the
other ones they still it's it's all this
the common theme though
>> but
>> yeah you can remove those which I would
suggest doing start from scratch
>> remove you go um old resumeumés
old profiles on those
uh platforms like Zip Recruiter and
Indeed. I mean, you should be anyway
because you should always be updating
that information. And then of course you
can remove your profile or uh at least
pause your profile so that you're not
receiving
those things anymore unsolicited sort of
stuff that maybe you don't want to
receive anymore or is out ofd.
Um,
so
your profile is your foundation. You've
built it. Now, it's about staying
visible and active.
So, I really think and and really want
to encourage all of you to review your
profile from a recruiter's perspective.
Ask a peer, you know, or a friend to
give you honest feedback.
Prepare one sentence that summarizes
your professional brand. Um, you know,
and that would be great if you're able
to make tomorrow's session because
tomorrow,
um, in my evening session, we'll take
everything that you've built and really,
you know, turn it into action. So, how
to use LinkedIn to generate
opportunities
and maintain consistency.
So, you know, we'll talk about job
alerts, search filters, outreach,
visibility,
you know, and
how often are you checking your alerts
and applying?
Are you having those job alerts
forwarded and funneled to your email
address? How are you navigating? How are
you
setting up the filters on LinkedIn to
work best for you?
Are you engaging? Are you commenting on
posts from recruiters or hiring leads
that hopefully you've been connecting
with because you've been researching who
they are after you apply to jobs in
certain companies if you are currently
applying. of course,
you know, and and
write a think about writing a visibility
post,
something that you can share this week,
maybe you know what you've learned,
maybe here at Joy of Coding, something
you learned this week.
could be a project that you all
completed, one that you're proud of,
maybe about how you are um
approaching approaching your job search
and and
following that up with what Michelle was
saying about hashtags,
post and then use a relevant hash
hashtag # job searcher
growth # software engineering. However,
whatever
it summarizes
what you've just posted,
right?
>> Is it um okay to like mention someone
else's
like conference? Like Tony Robbins has
an AI conference coming up. I think it's
a three-day weekend
>> and it sounds like it's going to be
awesome. He's incredible anyway, but if
I have dates and everything, it's free.
>> So, would that something
>> Yeah, I mean that's appropriate.
Absolutely. You know, for sure.
>> Okay.
>> Yeah, that would be something you could
post. Let people know it's happening.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah.
>> Okay.
Chelsea, are you still doing those 101
ones or that?
>> Um, I am like sprinkling them uh about
where I can.
Uh, we had our one-on-one. Yeah.
>> Yeah. Long time ago.
>> Okay. Okay. Yeah. I mean, if you're
looking for um, you know, a one-on-one
session, I can, you know, definitely
reach out. I can carve out some time and
reach out on Discord. That's the best
way to catch me.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. I kind of figured through uh
discount cord.
>> Yeah.
>> You know, Michelle, what were you
working on? I'm just curious. Like when
I gave you those 10 minutes, what were
you?
>> I found some typos, so I fixed that.
>> Oh, nice.
>> Yeah. And I looked at some people, you
know, I had got I had some messages, so
I looked at those and
>> Okay. Then I I looked at my banner and
my picture and I think it's pretty good.
Um there's pro there's a space there now
for projects though that I've never seen
before. So I'm going to have to update
that.
>> Okay.
>> So I kind of looked at that, but that's
going to take me some time and I have
to, you know, it's something I need to
concentrate on.
>> But I'll get that up to date. And I
don't have any hashtags because I don't
know exactly where they go. Well, they
go when you post like for instance, you
were saying you want to post the Tony
Robbins
>> Yeah,
>> post that.
>> Okay.
>> You could do post that and then put I
don't know. You could put whatever the
hashtags
conference hashtagconference hashtag
mindset hashtag Tony Robbins hashtag I
don't know whatever you want to.
>> We'll put those after the post. the
hashtags after the
>> Okay. All right.
>> That's how most people do it.
>> I' I've seen a a few different profiles
where they actually have hashtags like
in their banner area.
>> Mhm.
>> So, that's what I Is that supposed to
happen?
>> I mean, if that's what they want. I
personally don't think it looks relevant
or very tidy, but I mean
>> that's what they want to do with their
banner.
>> It's up to them, you know. It's entirely
up to you. Uh this these are just my
suggestions
>> and sort of like the industry of
recruiting that
catches our eye and sort of best
practices.
All right.
>> Yeah.
>> Um, in in in the first post that you
made in the comments, you have uh quotes
around fullstack developer and software
engineer
>> but not around JavaScript, React or
Node.
>> Yeah,
>> you don't do that because of software.
>> That's not it. That's just
what how you have to do the boolean
search.
>> Okay. All right.
>> Yeah,
>> I just wanted to make sure.
>> Yeah, no problem. Anyone else?
Okay. So again, my sessions are now
Tuesday evening and Wednesday evening,
both at 6:00 p.m.
I can oftent times squeeze in some
one-on-one time,
but definitely message me on Discord.
Um, and I again encourage you to look
through the sessions,
the recorded sessions because that will
give you all of the refresher that
you'll need.
Uh, I can definitely
help you with updated your LinkedIn
profile, but honestly, there's so much
content to review in those sessions. It
really does lay everything out. And
again, I can't impress upon you enough
to listen to what Dr. Emily says. Like,
if you do not utilize technology, you
will be a victim of it. It's there. AI
is there and you have loads a handful of
different platforms to choose from. And
you know
all you have to do is plug into
blog chat GPT. I am a software engineer.
I am looking to become a full stack
developer and
those are the type of roles that I am
focused on and applying to. Help me
craft a headline for LinkedIn. give me
three to five options and go from there.
>> And LinkedIn will not let you have two
profiles.
>> Um, I don't think so.
I don't really think you need two
different profiles.
I I because I'm a lighting designer and
I do computer work
>> design for for conferences and sales big
sales meetings and concerts and things
like that.
>> Oh, cool.
>> Because that I I still we really need to
meet because I struggle with how to make
those two meet or if it's even possible.
>> You can. It's possible for sure.
>> I think it's possible. Okay.
>> Um, yeah, I think it's possible.
>> Okay. Well, I could really use your help
with that.
>> Yeah. Well, give me a shout on Discord.
Um, and then of course, uh, again, I
will review what we did for the past 11
weeks quickly tomorrow night, what we've
reviewed tonight, and then we'll be
doing something slightly different
tomorrow. And then next week, my plan is
to start kicking off my resume series in
talking about how to start
uh crafting your resume. All right,
folks. So, have a wonderful evening. Uh
find me on Discord and I'm so happy to
see all of you and have a wonderful
evening. Yeah, I just shot your um IM on
Discord, so look at it when you can.
>> Okay, I will. Thanks, Anna.
>> All righty.
>> Thank you, Chelsea. Bye bye. You're
welcome. You, too. Bye. Bye.
