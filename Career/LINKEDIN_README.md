## Submit Your Profile for Review

The **Profile.csv** file is what I need to review your profile. Once you download it, you can either:

1. **Copy/paste the contents** of Profile.csv here, OR
2. **Upload the file** directly to this chat

I'll then give you a complete section-by-section review with specific rewrites optimized for recruiter searches.

## What You'll Receive

After submitting your profile, I'll provide:

- **Headline rewrite** using the proven formula: Role + Skills + Value Proposition
- **About section rewrite** following the 5-part structure recruiters respond to
- **Skills recommendations** (target: 30-50 skills, prioritized)
- **Keyword optimization** to match how recruiters search
- **All-Star profile checklist** showing what's complete and what's missing
- **Priority improvements** ranked by impact on recruiter visibility

## Tips for Best Results

- Export fresh data right before your review
- Have 2-3 target job descriptions ready (I'll extract keywords from them)
- Be ready to update your profile immediately after review
