## The Recruiter's Perspective

Recruiters use boolean searches to filter candidates. Profiles with complete information rank higher.

Engagement and activity boost visibility - commenting on posts, joining groups, following relevant people all contribute to being found.

### Example Boolean Search
```
("Full Stack Developer" OR "Software Engineer") AND (React OR NodeJS OR JavaScript) AND (API OR PostgreSQL OR AWS)
```

**Key question:** What would make YOUR profile appear in this search?

**Answer:** Keywords throughout:
- Headline should include "Full Stack Developer"
- Skills should list JavaScript, React, NodeJS
- Experience should mention projects using these technologies

## Profile Deep Dive Checklist

### Photo and Banner
- Is your image professional and clear?
- Does your banner represent your field?

### Headline
- Does it state your role, specialty, or target position?
- Include target job titles AND top skills

### About/Summary Section
- Does it tell your story clearly in 2-3 short paragraphs?
- Use AI (ChatGPT, Claude) to help craft it if stuck

### Experience and Projects
- Are projects explained with outcomes and tools used?
- List team size, your role, what you accomplished
- Include technology stack used

### Skills
- Are your top 10 skills relevant to jobs you're applying for?
- Are skills added for each position you've held?

### Recommendations
- Do you have at least 1-2 recommendations?

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Keyword stuffing or vague summaries** - Balance keywords with context
2. **Incomplete project descriptions** - Show measurable results
3. **Neglecting banner or headline** - Missed visibility opportunity
4. **Not engaging or posting** - Staying invisible

Every section should work together to tell the story of where you're headed next.

---

## Using Hashtags

Hashtags are valuable when posting:
- Attach to articles, podcasts, or content you share
- Use relevant professional tags: #SoftwareEngineering, #React, #JobSearch
- They make your posts searchable

**Note:** Some people put hashtags in their banner area, but it's not necessary. Best practice is using them in posts.

---

## Contact Information Best Practices

**List:**
- Email address (primary contact method)
- Custom LinkedIn URL
- Personal portfolio/website (when ready)

**Consider NOT listing:**
- Phone number (privacy/security concerns)
- Home address
- Birthday

**Reason:** Email address alone is sufficient. Recruiters will find ways to contact you if interested. Protecting personal information helps prevent identity theft.

---

## Education Section

**If graduated more than 5-8 years ago:**
- List the degree/institution
- Don't include graduation dates
- The world is ageist - keeping dates off prevents unconscious bias

**If asked about dates:** You can speak to it in conversation, but it doesn't need to be on the profile.

---

## Projects from Training Programs

Projects completed during bootcamps, academies, or training programs absolutely belong on your profile.

**Include:**
- Project name and description
- Your specific role
- Technologies/tools used
- Outcomes achieved
- Team members you collaborated with

**Why it matters:** Shows real work on real projects with real clients - exactly what employers want to see.

---

## Visibility and Engagement

### Staying Visible
- Post updates about projects and learning wins
- Comment on recruiter and industry posts
- Share relevant articles with hashtags
- Join groups where target company employees participate

### Visibility Post Ideas
- Project you're proud of
- Something you learned this week
- How you're approaching your job search
- Industry article with your commentary

### Hashtag Examples
#JobSearch #CareerGrowth #SoftwareEngineering #React #WebDevelopment

---

## Career Changers and Multiple Skills

**If you have multiple career paths** (e.g., creative work AND tech):
- Consider which to prioritize on your main profile
- You CAN have two LinkedIn profiles for different career paths
- Example: One for creative/design work, one for software development
- Use different names or company names to differentiate

---

## Using AI Effectively

AI can help with:
- Crafting headlines
- Writing about sections
- Describing projects
- Boolean searches

**Prompt example:** "I am a software engineer. I am looking to become a full stack developer and those are the type of roles I am applying to. Help me craft a headline for LinkedIn. Give me 3-5 options."

**Warning:** Edit AI output to sound authentic. Recruiters can spot pure AI copy-paste.

---

## LinkedIn Premium

Not required for basic profile optimization. However, if you're in an active job search:
- Premium provides additional visibility
- More search filter options
- See who viewed your profile

---

## Final Action Items

1. Review your profile from a recruiter's perspective
2. Ask a peer or friend for honest feedback
3. Prepare one sentence summarizing your professional brand
4. Update one section at a time - don't get overwhelmed
5. Start from the top: Photo → Banner → Headline → About → Experience → Skills → Recommendations

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Every section is searchable** - optimize all of them
2. **Headlines need keywords** - not just job titles
3. **Projects need outcomes** - show what you accomplished
4. **Recommendations add credibility** - get at least 1-2
5. **Engagement boosts visibility** - post and comment regularly

8. **Take it step by step** - photo and banner first, then work down
9. **This is ongoing** - LinkedIn profiles constantly evolve
10. **Technology is your tool** - if you don't use it, it will overwhelm you
