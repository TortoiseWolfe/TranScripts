## Recap: Why LinkedIn Matters

LinkedIn is a recruiter's first stop. 95% of recruiters and hiring managers use it daily to source talent. Even if you've applied through a job board, they'll check your LinkedIn profile first.

If referred from an internal hiring manager, external recruiter, or friend - they look at LinkedIn first. It serves as your public resume and reputation all in one.

**Your photo and headline = their first impression.**

## Headline Deep Dive

### Why Headlines Are Important

- **Searchable** - recruiters find you through keywords
- **Highly visible** - often the only thing seen before clicking
- **Defines your narrative** - your elevator pitch

### Headline Formula

**Role/Identity + Skills & Tools + What You're Excited About**

The components can be in any order - doesn't have to follow exact structure.

## Workshop: Creating Your Headlines

### Activity

Come up with 3 different headline options. Look at your current headline and create variations.

### Using AI Effectively

**Conversation approach:**
1. Give context: "I'm trying to get this role. I can do this. It needs to appeal to this crowd."
2. Ask follow-up questions like you would with a real person
3. Dump in your current headline AND resume
4. Ask: "Based on this, give me a headline that will do XYZ"
5. Keep refining - it's not a one-shot process

**Balance tip:** Ask AI for options that balance:
- Keyword-heavy (recruiter-friendly, searchable)
- Personality-driven (stand out, show who you are)

**Pro tip:** Tell AI "don't sound robotic - bring warmth and friendliness" for better results.

## Junior vs Full Stack Developer Title

**Question:** If we present as "junior dev," are we excluded from consideration?

**Answer:** It depends on where you're at. Many open roles are mid/senior level. Sometimes you need to "fake it till you make it."

The TechJoy program has metrics showing graduates landing six-figure salaries. You'll have excellent training.

---

## Borrowing from Other Profiles

**Question:** Is it okay to look at other profiles and borrow what I like?

**Answer:** Absolutely. As the saying goes: "Code you wrote is good. Code you stole is great."

Get inspired by others, then tailor to yourself. This doesn't negatively impact search algorithms.

---

## LinkedIn Searchability

### What's Searchable

- Headlines
- Open to Work status
- Remote/hybrid/on-site preferences
- About section
- Experience
- Education (including years)
- Skills
- Organization history with date ranges

**Example search:** Software engineers who worked at OpenAI from 2016-2017.

---

## Open to Work: Best Practices

### Don't Use the Banner

The green "Open to Work" banner is visible to everyone, including your current employer.

### Do Use the Setting

Mark yourself as "open to work" in settings (edit top section of profile). People at your current company will be blocked from seeing this status.

---

## Contact Information

### Include

- Professional email (Gmail preferred, avoid AOL/old platforms)
- LinkedIn profile link
- GitHub
- Portfolio sites

### Don't Include

- Phone number
- Mailing address

**Reasoning:** "They can have that information when they hire you. That's the present they get."

---

## Salary Negotiation Insights

### Internal Equity Matters

Recruiters consider internal equity - what current employees at similar levels make.

**Scenario:** If the highest person on team makes $150K and you want $160K, the company may not be able to offer that even if the budget allows it.

### Coming in at Top of Band

If you come in at the top of the salary band, you won't get raises the next year because you've already hit the ceiling.

**Ideal:** Come in with room to grow, not hitting a glass ceiling.

### The Bigger Picture

Questions to consider:
- Is this the opportunity you want?
- Is this the culture you want?
- Will this help you reach your personal goals?

"Sometimes it's about the opportunity. Sometimes you have to go back $10K."

But also: "Don't go to work with jerks."

- Something that shows personality
