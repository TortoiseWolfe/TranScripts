## LinkedIn as a Research Tool

LinkedIn is more than a digital resume. It's a database of companies, people, and opportunities. If you learn to research effectively, you'll always be ahead of the average job seeker.

---

## Three Research Categories

### 1. Company Research
- Look up your target company page
- Go to the "People" tab to see:
  - Alumni
  - Recruiters
  - Employees with relevant titles
- Check the **Insights tab** for:
  - Growth trends
  - Locations
  - Headcount changes
  - Open jobs
- Review if company is hiring aggressively or shrinking before applying

### 2. Role and Career Path Research
- Search job titles (Full Stack Developer, QA Engineer)
- Review profiles of people currently in those roles
- Look at their:
  - Career trajectory
  - Previous companies
  - Groups they belong to
  - Skills listed
- Discover new companies through where others have worked

### 3. Recruiter and Hiring Manager Search
- Filter by job title in the People section
- Search: `"Technical Recruiter" AND [Target Company]`
- Follow recruiters, engage with their posts
- Connect with tailored notes

---

## Understanding Company Insights

When viewing a company page, click **Insights** to see:
- Employee growth percentage (e.g., "131% growth in past 6 months")
- Recent hires count
- Headcount by function (Engineering, Sales, etc.)
- Where alumni went after leaving
- Competitor companies

**Strategic use:** If a company shows strong growth in engineering, they're likely hiring aggressively for tech roles.

---

## Understanding Connection Levels

- **1st connections:** People you know well, interact with frequently
- **2nd connections:** People you don't know directly but share mutual connections
- **3rd connections:** No direct connection, no mutual contacts

---

## What is a Boolean Search?

A search method using operators (AND, OR, NOT, quotes, parentheses) to refine results.

**Why it matters:**
- Recruiters use boolean searching every day to find talent
- Job seekers can use it to research recruiters, companies, and target roles
- It's a logic-based way of telling LinkedIn exactly what to include or exclude

---

## Boolean Search Operators

### AND (Must include both terms)
`"Software Engineer" AND Amazon`
- Shows only software engineers who work at Amazon

### OR (Include either term)
`"Full Stack Developer" OR "Front-End Developer"`
- Shows both types of developers

### NOT (Exclude a term)
`Recruiter NOT HR`
- Shows recruiters but excludes HR recruiters

### Quotes (Exact phrase match)
`"Machine Learning Engineer"`
- Returns exact job title, not words separately

### Parentheses (Group terms for complex searches)
`("Full Stack Developer" OR "Software Engineer") AND Amazon`
- Combines multiple conditions

---

## Boolean Search Examples

**Finding recruiters at a target company:**
```
"Technical Recruiter" AND Google
```

**Finding developers with specific skills:**
```
"Software Engineer" AND Amazon
```

**Finding multiple role types at a company:**
```
("Full Stack Developer" OR "Front-End Developer") AND Amazon
```

**Excluding certain recruiter types:**
```
"Tech Recruiter" NOT Agency
```

## Practical Application

When you find a job posting:
1. Research the company using the Insights tab
2. Check recent growth and hiring trends
3. Find recruiters using boolean search
4. Identify people in your target role
5. Connect strategically with personalized notes

---

## Targeting Large Companies

For companies with 10,000+ employees:
- Filter by department or role type
- Focus on finding:
  - Recruiters/sourcers for your function
  - Hiring leads for your target team
  - People currently in the role you want
- Don't try to search through all employees

---

## Key Takeaways

1. LinkedIn is a research database, not just a profile host
2. Use the **Insights tab** to evaluate company health before applying
3. Boolean searches give you precise control over results
4. **AND** narrows results, **OR** expands them, **NOT** excludes
5. Quotes ensure exact phrase matching
6. Recruiters use these same techniques to find you
7. Research companies before applying to target outreach effectively
8. LinkedIn is an active search and networking tool, not passive
