## Recap: Why LinkedIn Matters

LinkedIn is a recruiter's first step to reviewing a candidate. Whether referred by an internal employee, applied online directly, or handed a paper resume at a career fair - recruiters always go to LinkedIn first. 95% of recruiters and hiring managers use it daily to source talent.

Even if you apply through a job board, they'll often check your LinkedIn before reaching out. It serves as your public resume and reputation all in one.

**Your photo and headline = your first impression.**

## Profile Photo

### Why a Good Photo Matters

First impression and profile visibility are crucial.

**Guidelines (Do's):**
- Clear headshot
- Well lit
- Plain background
- Dressed appropriately for tech (casual but neat)
- Smile or neutral expression
- Friendly, approachable expression

**Don'ts:**
- Selfies
- Filters
- Group shots
- Blurry/low resolution photos
- Photos with others (including pets)

### Free Tools and Options

- **Canva** - cropping and editing
- **Phone portrait mode** - for clean background blur
- **YouTube tutorials** - photographers who teach how to angle, sit, and use lighting
- **AI platforms** - upload 6-8 clean photos and they create a professional composite
- **Job fairs/tech events** - often have photo booths for professional headshots

## Banner Image

### Why It Matters

Visual branding and profile differentiation. It's the largest graphic on your profile - don't leave it blank.

### Banner Ideas

- **Branded tech banners** - GitHub, Code Newbie
- **Program branding** - ask permission to use TechJoy branding
- **Personal project screenshots**
- **Code snippets**
- **City skyline**
- **IDE backgrounds**
- **Abstract tech imagery**
- **Personal branding or quote**

**Canva templates:** Search "LinkedIn banner" for many options.

## Contact Information

### What to Include

- **Professional email** - use Gmail or current platform, avoid old university emails or outdated platforms (AOL)
- **GitHub portfolio**
- **Personal site/portfolio**
- **Customize your LinkedIn URL**

### What NOT to Include

- Personal phone number
- Mailing address

### Pro Tip: Visibility Settings

Check your visibility settings - recruiters should be able to reach you. Go into settings and make sure you're visible to recruiters and marked as "open to work" if you're job searching.

## The Headline

### Why Headlines Matter

- **Searchable** - recruiters find you through headline keywords
- **Highly visible** - often the only thing people see before clicking
- **Defines your narrative**

It's your elevator pitch in 50-100 characters.

### Headline Formula

**Role/Identity + Skills & Tools + What You're Excited About (Soft Skills)**

### Example

"Junior Front-End Developer | React, JavaScript, CSS | Building clean UIs and scalable applications"

### Do's

- Be specific (not just "aspiring developer")
- Mention tech stack
- Include value proposition
- Mix hard and soft skills

### Don'ts

- "Aspiring developer looking for opportunities" (too vague)
- "Recent boot camp grad" (not ideal for headline)
- Filler phrases like "looking for opportunities" (assumed)
