## Your Profile vs Your Presence

Your LinkedIn profile is your storefront. How you show up in the feed is how people see you walking around the neighborhood.

**Questions to consider:**
- Are you engaged?
- Are you visible?
- What do you use LinkedIn for?

**Key insight:** Networking is more important than the actual application. It's your way to start engaging with people you're excited to possibly work with.

---

## Principles Review

The strongest networks come from relationships that feel natural, human, and mutually supportive.

**You don't have to wait until you need something to reach out.** That's what makes it feel transactional.

**Think of it like watering a plant.** Small check-ins every few months keep connections alive.

**Key principles:** Consistency, curiosity, gratitude, value sharing.

---

## Following Up After Applications

When you see a job posting on LinkedIn, often the person who posted it is listed.

**Process:**
1. Apply to the job
2. Search for that person's profile
3. Follow them
4. Go to "More" dropdown → Connect or Message
5. Let them know you applied and what you can bring

This works for recruiters, talent acquisition, and HR professionals leading searches.

## Target Company Outreach

If you have target companies you want to work for:
1. Research the company on LinkedIn
2. Find the company page
3. Click on employees
4. Look for people in your target role or recruiters
5. Connect and engage

## Best Practices for Commenting

### Weak Comment
"Congrats" (with auto-balloon emoji)

### Strong Comment
"Congrats on the promotion! What's been the most exciting change in your role so far?"

### Comment Framework
1. **Acknowledge** - Congrats, thanks, interesting
2. **Add perspective** - A story, insight, or question
3. **Keep it short** - 2-3 sentences max

**Key point:** Your comments reflect your voice and expertise more than your profile sometimes does.

## Three Rules of a Genuine Network Message

### 1. Keep It Short
Aim for 2-3 sentences max. Long messages feel overwhelming, especially if you haven't spoken in a while or never met.

**Think:** Quick check-in, not a full catch-up essay.

**Example:** "Hi Sam, congrats on your new role at Joy of Coding. How's the transition been for you so far?"

### 2. Make It Specific
Reference something real:
- A past conversation
- Their career move
- A recent post
- A shared experience

**Specificity shows you're paying attention, not mass-messaging.**

### 3. Add Curiosity
End with a gentle, open-ended question that invites them to reply. Avoid questions that feel like a big ask or require lots of effort.

**Example:** "Hi Allison, I remembered you mentioned launching a project last time we spoke. How's it been doing?"

---

## Quick Formula

**Greeting + Specific Detail + Brief Acknowledgment/Gratitude + Light Question**

### Examples

"Hi Chris, I just saw it's your 2-year anniversary at Joy of Coding. Congrats. What's been the biggest change in your role since you started?"

"Hey Alex, thanks again for recommending that podcast months ago. I've been hooked. Have you come across any new ones you've been enjoying?"

"Hey Jordan, I noticed your team just launched a new product. Congratulations. What part of the process do you enjoy the most?"

---

## Guided Practice: Writing Comments

**Scenario:** Someone posts an article about "Why Junior Developers Struggle in Interviews."

**Your task:** Write a comment that adds to the conversation.

### Sample Responses

**Performance anxiety angle:**
"I totally relate - performance anxiety and not having done the necessary prep work in university made early interviews tough. The technical practice is one thing, but presenting yourself confidently is another skill entirely."

**Confidence angle:**
"That's a great topic. I believe how candidates present themselves plays a big part - do they show confidence or seem reserved? Preparation and practice with talking about yourself makes a huge difference."

## When to Create Posts

Good reasons to post:
- Podcast or article that inspired you
- Project you completed (with permission)
- Insight from your learning journey
- Shoutout to collaborators
- Professional milestones

**Frequency:** Once a week or every other week. Focus on quality over quantity.

---

## What Makes Posts Feel Fake

- Bragging without substance
- Generic inspirational quotes
- Walls of text
- Overly promotional content

**Tips for Authenticity:**
- Use your own voice, not corporate jargon
- Highlight others' work, not just your own
- Share genuine insights, not performative content
- Keep it professional but personable

---

## The Coffee Chat Strategy

Reaching out to people at target companies for virtual coffee chats:
- Some accept and have great conversations
- Some can't meet but answer questions via message
- Some don't respond (that's okay)

**Template questions:**
- What do you enjoy most about working there?
- What skills matter most for roles like this?
- How has your role evolved?
- What surprised you about the industry?

---

## Internal Equity and Salary (Recruiter Perspective)

When recruiters hire, they consider internal equity - what current employees at similar levels make.

**Scenario:** If the highest person on the team makes $150K and you want $170K, the company may not offer that even if budget allows - it creates pay inequity.

**Coming in at top of band:** You won't get raises the next year because you've already hit the ceiling.

**Tip:** Sometimes it's about the opportunity, culture, and growth potential. Consider: "I don't want to price myself out of consideration. I'm happy to be considered within the posted salary band."

---

## Lowballing Strategically

**Question:** Is there value in lowballing to get your foot in the door?

**How to articulate it:**
"Yes, I've made more in past roles, but this role is one where I know I can be impactful. I can grow, succeed, and bring everyone else with me. I don't want to price myself out of consideration, so I'm happy to be considered within the salary band."

---

## Visibility is Critical

**First thing recruiters do:** Go to your LinkedIn before looking at your resume.

**What they check:**
- Banner and professional photo
- Headline (not just "Software Developer" - include skills and soft skills)
- Contact information (email address!)
- Summary (meaningful narrative, not bullet points)
- Activity (are you engaged?)

**Contact info matters:** If a recruiter can't reach you, they'll delete your message. Fill out your contact information.

---

## Sharing Your Work

**Always ask permission** before posting client work.

**Chain of command:**
1. Ask your PM/coordinator
2. They check with account/client services
3. Client approves or declines

**What you can share:**
- Launched/produced projects
- Challenge week projects
- Personal projects

**How to share:**
- Tag collaborators
- Shout out team members
- Keep it professional
