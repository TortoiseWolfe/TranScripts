## Boolean Search Operators in Action

### AND Operator
Requires both terms to appear.

**Example:** `"Software Engineer" AND Amazon`
- Results: Software engineers at Amazon
- Can click "People" to see all matching profiles
- Shows jobs, posts, and people matching criteria

### OR Operator
Shows results matching either term.

**Example:** `"Full Stack Developer" OR "Front-End Developer"`
- Results: Both types of developers
- Useful when you're open to multiple role types

**Combined example:** `("Full Stack Developer" OR "Front-End Developer") AND Amazon`
- Results: Either role type specifically at Amazon

### NOT Operator
Excludes specific terms.

**Example:** `"Tech Recruiter" NOT Agency`
- Results: Tech recruiters excluding agency recruiters
- Useful for finding in-house recruiters

### Quotes
Ensures exact phrase matching.

**Example:** `"Machine Learning Engineer"`
- Results: Exact job title only
- Without quotes, words could appear separately

## Handling Title Variations

**Challenge:** Job titles are written inconsistently:
- Full Stack / Full-Stack / Fullstack
- Front End / Front-End / Frontend

**Solution options:**
- Use OR to cover variations: `"Full Stack" OR "Full-Stack" OR "Fullstack"`
- Search multiple times with different variations
- Test what returns most relevant results

## Targeting Large Companies

For companies with thousands of employees:

1. **Focus on specific departments** rather than searching all employees
2. **Target recruiters first** - they're the first line of contact
3. **Find hiring leads** - people who might manage the role
4. **Filter by job function** when available

**Key question:** "Who is sourcing for these roles?"
- Answer: Recruiters. That's your first target.
