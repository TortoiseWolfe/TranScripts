## The Recruiter's Perspective

Recruiters use boolean searches to filter candidates. Profiles with complete information rank higher in searches.

Even recommendations are searchable - keywords within them contribute to your visibility.

Engagement and activity also boost visibility. When you comment on posts in your feed or participate in groups, recruiters can find those comments through searches.

## Recommendations Best Practices

### When to Ask
- Recommendations should be fairly recent
- Best timing: After completing a project, leaving a position, or receiving positive feedback

### Who to Ask
