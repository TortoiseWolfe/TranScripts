## How Recruiters Use LinkedIn

### Boolean Searches
Recruiters use boolean searches to filter candidates. Profiles with complete information rank higher.

### Example Recruiter Search
```
("Full Stack Developer" OR "Software Engineer") AND (JavaScript OR React OR Node) AND (SQL OR AWS OR API OR PostgreSQL)
```

**Question to ask yourself:** What would make YOUR profile appear in this search?

### Answer: Your Entire Profile
- Keywords in headline
- Skills listed
- Activity and engagement
- Connections with relevant people

---

## Profile Deep Dive Checklist

### Photo and Banner
- Is your image professional and clear?
- Does your banner represent your field?

### Headline
- Does it state your role, specialty, or target position?
- Include searchable keywords (Full Stack Developer, QA Engineer, etc.)

### About/Summary Section
- Does it tell your story clearly in 2-3 short paragraphs?

### Experience and Projects
- Are projects explained with outcomes and tools used?
- List what you accomplished, not just what you did

### Skills
- Are your top 10 skills relevant to jobs you're applying for?
- Add skills for each position you've held

### Recommendations
- Do you have at least 1-2 recommendations?

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Keyword stuffing** and vague summaries
2. **Incomplete project descriptions** - not showing measurable results
3. **Neglecting banner or headline** altogether
4. **No engagement or posting** - staying invisible

Every section should work together to tell the story of where you're headed next.

## Making LinkedIn Work for You

### LinkedIn Works When You Do

After building your profile foundation, focus on:
- **Building traction** through consistent activity
- **Making meaningful connections** with the right people
- **Creating visibility** that leads to interviews

### Connect Meaningfully

When you apply to a role:
1. Search for the company on LinkedIn
2. Click on "People"
3. Find and connect with recruiters and people with your target title
4. Send a personalized message referencing your application

**Message template:**
"Hi, I just applied to [Role]. Attached is my resume. I'm impressed with [specific thing about company/values/article]. I'd love to learn more about what your team is looking for."

### Research Connections
- Look at profiles of people at target companies
- Check what groups they belong to
- Join those groups
- Repost relevant articles with hashtags
- Show that you're doing the work

---

## Setting Up Your Job Search System

### Job Alerts
- LinkedIn notifies you when roles match your target
- Set alerts for jobs posted within 1-24 hours
- If a job was posted 3 days ago with 100+ applicants, don't bother

### Search Filters
- Refine and prioritize your search filters
- Save multiple searches for different role types

### Outreach
- Connect with talent acquisition and recruiters at target companies
- Connect with hiring leads and team members
- Forward your resume with a meaningful intro

### Visibility
- Engage with posts
- Post your own updates
- Stay top of mind

---

## The Power of Engagement

### Commenting on Recruiter Posts
When you engage with recruiters' and hiring leads' posts, you become visible to them.

### Share Short Updates About:
- Projects you're working on
- Learning wins
- Career progress

### Post Template
"Look at what I've completed. This is a project I'm really proud of. I did this at [Program/Company]."

Include the people you collaborated with and relevant hashtags.

## Strategic Outreach

**Every job application should be paired with outreach.**

Keep it short, specific, and friendly:

"Hi, I saw your post about the Software Developer role at [Company]. I'm a developer focused on [your skills]. I'd love to learn more about what your team is looking for when hiring."

**Pro tip:** Use AI (ChatGPT, Claude) to help craft these messages, then personalize them.

---

## Using AI Strategically

AI can help with:
- Crafting outreach messages
- Tailoring resumes to job descriptions
- Writing thank you letters
- Generating LinkedIn content ideas

**Warning:** Don't sound robotic. Edit AI output to sound authentic. Recruiters can spot pure AI copy-paste.

**Telltale signs of AI:** M-dashes, overly formal language, generic phrasing.
