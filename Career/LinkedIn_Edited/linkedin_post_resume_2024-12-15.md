```
🔧 Built my resume as a web app because... why not practice what I preach?

After 2.5 years building Revit automation plugins and 4+ years in React/TypeScript, I figured my resume should show—not just tell—what I can do.

🎯 Features:
• Dark/light mode
• One-click PDF/DOCX export
• Calendly integration to skip the back-and-forth

Currently seeking full stack or automation roles! 🛠️
