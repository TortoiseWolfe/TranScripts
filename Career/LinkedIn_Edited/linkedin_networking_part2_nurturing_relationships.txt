## The Real Power of Networking

We've built our storefront (profile) and made initial connections. Now the real power comes from **nurturing those connections into lasting relationships**.

### Key Insight
We often think networking is about getting a job or asking for something. But the strongest networks come from relationships that feel **natural, human, and mutually supportive**.

### The Application Still Matters
Even if you're a referral or a recruiter finds you on LinkedIn, they'll still send you a link to apply. ATS systems generate your offer letter and transfer information to HR/payroll systems. But networking gets you noticed before and during that process.

## Principles of Relationship Nurturing

### 1. Consistency
Think of it like watering a plant. If you only water it once a year, it dies. Small check-ins every few months keep the connection alive.

**Take baby steps:** Maybe send 5-10 LinkedIn connections per week with a meaningful intro.

### 2. Curiosity
Asking thoughtful questions shows genuine interest.

**Example:** "You mentioned last time that you're leading a new project. How's it going?"

### 3. Gratitude
A simple thank you goes far.

**Example:** "Thanks again for sharing that article. It's been useful." or "Thanks for taking time to answer my questions. I so appreciate that you carved time out of your day."

### 4. Value Sharing
Share something useful without expecting anything back.

**Example:** Share a project you've been working on, an article that might interest them, or insights from your learning journey.

## Examples of Genuine Check-Ins

**Context-based:**
"Hi Jordan, I just saw an article about UX design trends and it reminded me of the great conversation we had about design challenges last year. How have things been on your end?"

**Curiosity-driven:**
"Hi Sam, I remember you mentioned you were starting a new role around the time we last spoke. How has that transition been for you?"

**Gratitude and check-in:**
"Hi Taylor, thanks again for the advice you gave me about project management tools last year. I ended up using Trello and it's been a game changer. How's everything been with you?"

**Life update anchor:**
"Hi Chris, it's been a little while since we connected. I recently started at TechJoy Academy and it made me think of your journey. How have things been with your projects?"

**Work anniversary:**
"Hey Glenn, congrats on your 2-year anniversary at Company X. How has your role grown since you started?"

**Team expansion:**
"Hey Alex, you mentioned your team was expanding. How's that going? It must be exciting."

## Weak Transactional Openers to Avoid

- "Hi, I'm job hunting and wondered if you'd know of any openings."
- "Hey, we haven't talked in a while. Can you refer me to your company?"
- "Hey, do you have 15 minutes for a call this week?" (without context)

## The Coffee Chat Approach

Reaching out to people at target companies to see if they'd be interested in a virtual coffee chat has been very effective.

**What happens:**
- Some people accept and have great conversations
- Some can't meet but offer to answer questions via message
- Some don't respond (that's okay)

**Questions to ask in coffee chats:**
- What do you enjoy most about working there?
- What skills matter most for roles like this?
- How has your role evolved since you started?
- What surprised you about the industry/company?

**Follow-up:** Keep in touch with people who helped you. Check in on their new job, congratulate them on milestones.

## Role Play Exercise: Breaking the Silence

**Scenario:** You connected with someone 8 months ago after meeting at an event. You had a nice exchange but haven't spoken since. How do you reconnect naturally?

**Framework:**
- What context do you share?
- Can you show curiosity about their life or work?
- Can you share a small update from your side?

**Sample Openers:**

1. "Hey, I saw this article that reminded me of our conversation. How have you been? Are you still working at [company]?"

2. "Hi Chelsea, we met at the AI and Machine Learning symposium in June. How are you doing? Did you get a chance to work on the Miami project?"

3. "Hey, have you been able to use any of what we learned at that talk in real life? I found it helpful with [specific thing]."

## Reconnecting with Old Contacts

**Example:** Someone from high school is now a consultant in tech. You weren't necessarily friends, but you knew each other.

**Approach:**
"Hey [name], it's so nice to see you! I stumbled on your profile on LinkedIn. It's been so long. I'm actually also involved in this space now. I'd love to connect and catch up. Do you have time for a coffee chat? Maybe we could even meet in person if you're local."

The existing relationship, even if distant, makes it warmer and more natural.

## Sample Follow-Up Scenarios

**After a long silence:**
"Hey Jordan, it's been a while since we connected after that UX event. I was just thinking about our conversation and wanted to check in. How have things been going?"

**After someone changed jobs:**
"Hey Sam, I saw you started at Joy of Coding. Congratulations! I'd love to hear what your first few months have been like."

**After they posted something interesting:**
"Hi Taylor, I really enjoyed that post on AI trends. I've been noticing some of those shifts myself. What's been the most surprising change you've seen so far?"

**After a work anniversary:**
"Hey Chris, congrats on your 2-year anniversary at Joy of Coding. How has your role grown since you started?"

**After they spoke on a panel or podcast:**
"Hi Alex, I saw you were on the panel about design careers. Congratulations. What was the best question you were asked?"

**After they achieved something:**
"Hey Jordan, congrats on your promotion. What's been the most exciting part of stepping into this new role?"

**Circle back after they helped you:**
"Hey Chris, thanks again for recommending Trello a while back. It's really made managing my projects so much easier. How's everything going with your work lately?"

## Sharing Work and Projects

**Always ask permission** before posting client work. Go through your PM, then account services, then the client. Some projects can't be highlighted externally due to NDAs.

**What you CAN share:**
- Projects that have been launched/produced
- Challenge week projects
- Personal projects
- Anything approved by your team lead

**When sharing:**
- Tag collaborators
- Give credit to team members
- Keep descriptions professional but personable
