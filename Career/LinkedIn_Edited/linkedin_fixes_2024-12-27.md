# LinkedIn Updates - 2024-12-27

Updates to align LinkedIn with corrected resume (accuracy fixes + .NET desktop frameworks).

## 1. Summary/About Section

**Current issues:**
- Says "12+ drafters" (should be "a dozen")
- Missing WPF, WinForms, MAUI, Blazor experience

**Copy-paste replacement:**

```
I'm a full stack developer who turns workflow bottlenecks into automated solutions. My most impactful project: a Revit plugin that reduced multi-minute dimensioning tasks to milliseconds—now used daily by a dozen drafters.

My stack spans C#, React, TypeScript, Next.js, Node.js, and React Native. I've evaluated WPF, WinForms, .NET MAUI, and Blazor for cross-platform .NET development, building MVPs in each to determine the best approach for AI chat integration. I've also built cross-platform mobile apps with Firebase, integrated RESTful APIs, and containerized environments with Docker.

A background in graphic design gives me strong UI/UX instincts—I build tools that work and feel right to use. Currently building educational platforms at ScriptHammer.com. Looking for roles where I can build tools that solve real problems for teams.

## 2. Trinam Design - Experience Description

## 3. Skills to Add

Go to: LinkedIn > Me > View Profile > Skills > Add Skill

**Add these 4 skills:**
- WPF

**Note:** You already have ".Net" listed. These are the specific UI frameworks that job postings like Barcom look for.

## 4. Headline (Optional)

Current headline is fine for brevity. If you want to emphasize .NET desktop:

**Current:**
```
Full Stack Software Developer | C# • React • TypeScript • Node.js | Building Automation tools that cut tasks from minutes to milliseconds
```

**Alternative (if targeting .NET desktop roles):**
```
Full Stack Developer | C# • .NET MAUI • React • TypeScript | Building automation tools that solve real workflow problems
```
