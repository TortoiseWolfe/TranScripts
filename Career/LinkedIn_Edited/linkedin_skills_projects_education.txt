## Session Goal

Leave with clarity on:
1. What skills to list on LinkedIn and resume
2. How to present projects from TechJoy Academy
3. How to leverage boot camp experience confidently

**Key question to carry through:** If someone looked at your LinkedIn profile right now, what would they think your superpower is?

You don't need 10 years of experience to have a strong LinkedIn. Clarity and confidence always win.

## Understanding the Skills Section

### Hard Skills vs Soft Skills

**Frame it like this:**
- Hard skills get you the interview
- Soft skills help you pass it and keep the job

Both are essential. Tech is a team sport - you can't do a job in this industry alone. It's always collaborative.

---

## Hard Skills: What You Can Do

Technical, teachable abilities learned through training or hands-on experience. Easy to measure, show up in job descriptions and LinkedIn skill lists.

**Examples for developers:**
- JavaScript, React, Node.js
- Git, GitHub
- REST APIs
- Debugging tools (VS Code, Postman, Figma)
- Test-driven development
- SQL, NoSQL

**Think of hard skills as tools in your toolbox.** They show what you can build.

---

## Soft Skills: How You Work With Others

These are often the most critical skills. You can be a master coder, but if you're not a problem solver, lack empathy, or can't give and receive feedback - that prevents elevation to senior, manager, director, or C-suite.

**Examples:**
- Problem solving
- Communication
- Time management
- Adaptability
- Teamwork and collaboration
- Empathy
- Giving and receiving feedback
- Mentorship

**Soft skills are your reputation.** They're how you use your tools and how well you work with others while doing it.

---

## Recruiter Secrets: Skills Section

- ATS and LinkedIn Recruiter heavily rely on the skills section
- Skills in your profile should match those in job descriptions
- Focus on relevant skills for today's job market, not just what you've learned
- **Add 30-50 skills** - LinkedIn allows up to 50
- Lean profiles (few skills) signal either limited experience or someone who hasn't maintained their profile

### Mentorship as a Skill

If you're a peer mentor, list "mentor" or "mentorship" as a skill. This is critical because:
- You'll be tasked with mentoring juniors in future roles
- Organizations assign buddies/mentors to new employees
- It shows leadership potential

---

## Framing Projects Like a Pro

The academy gives you real projects - critical for showing you've worked on real work with real teams, not just attended classes.

### Project Framework Formula

**What it is + What tools you used + What you built + Impact/Result**

### Example

"Built a full-stack budgeting app using React, Node.js, and MongoDB that allowed users to track expenses. Designed UI for intuitive UX, deployed with Netlify. Reduced friction for new users by 25% in testing."

### Important Notes on Metrics

- Only include metrics if you can talk about them and quantify them
- If you can't quantify, just state what you did, tools used, and what you built
- For projects without clear metrics, focus on: delivering a complete, usable product by deadline

### Example Without Metrics

"Collaborated on a team to build a task manager in four days. Delivered 100% complete and usable product by strict deadline following SLICK methodology (Simple, Lovable, Complete)."

## Highlighting Boot Camp / Education

Boot camps and certification programs aren't just training - they're proof of commitment and skill development.

**Boot camp is more than coursework.** It's full-on project-based learning.

### What to Include

1. Name the boot camp/academy
2. List technologies learned
3. Notable projects
4. Additional certifications (if applicable)

---

## LinkedIn Format: Education Section

```
TechJoy Academy
Full Stack Web Development Certificate Program
[Start Date] - [End Date]

Technologies Learned: React, Next.js, Node.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, GitHub, CI/CD

---

## Resume Format: Education Section

```
TechJoy Academy | Certificate in Full Stack Web Development | [Date]

• Completed immersive 16-week program focused on modern web development practices and collaborative project work
• Technologies: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, GitHub, CI/CD

**Difference from LinkedIn:**
- More condensed
- Bullet format
- Same information, different structure

---

## LinkedIn vs Resume: Key Differences

| LinkedIn | Resume |
|----------|--------|
| Human approach, who you are | More formal, professional |
| First person narrative | Structured bullets |
| Can elaborate more | Condensed format |
| Shows personality | Straight to the point |

Both should mirror each other closely, but LinkedIn allows for more personality.

---

## Experience Section: Skills Not Duties

**Don't list duties/responsibilities** in your experience section - that's antiquated for 2025.

**Replace duties with skills.** Skills are what pull you into recruiter searches. LinkedIn searches pick from skills you select, not everything you've written.

- Duties go on your resume
- Discuss duties in interviews
- Use cover letters to stand out (they're back due to saturated job market)

---

## Should I List Non-Tech Jobs?

**Yes, include previous non-tech jobs** - especially to show transferable skills.

- Your journey matters
- Shows you've worked, have life experience
- No need to hide career history
- Much more acceptable post-COVID to have varied career paths

---

## Homework

1. Update skills and education sections on LinkedIn (and resume)
2. Add at least one project with a strong description
3. **Bonus:** Share one project on LinkedIn this week with a short caption, tag TechJoy

---

## The Networking Push

Applying to jobs doesn't end when you click submit.

**After applying:**
1. Research the company on LinkedIn
2. Look at what they've done, what they're famous for
3. Follow people who work there
4. Connect with relevant employees
5. Message them:

"I recently applied to [position]. I'm inspired by the work you do. One project that impressed me was [specific project]. I'm enthusiastic about joining your team and know this is how I could contribute."

**This visibility is what lands jobs.** Sometimes recruiters receive messages and put interesting candidates in LinkedIn projects for future roles, or share profiles with hiring managers for positions not yet posted.

---

## Standing Out in a Saturated Market

- It's a unique market (not just tough) - find creative ways to stand out
- 70-85% of roles filled through networking
- Referral bonuses exist at most companies ($200-$15,000)
- Be "buttoned up and ready" - you never know when opportunities appear

**Key insight:** Your LinkedIn and resume represent your digital reputation. Be meticulous now when it counts most.
