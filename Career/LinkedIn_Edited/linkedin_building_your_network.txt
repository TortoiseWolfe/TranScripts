## The PEAR Framework: Who to Connect With

Think of the acronym **PEAR**:

**P - Peers**
Developers who are a step ahead of you or at other companies you're excited to work with.

**E - Employers**
Hiring managers, recruiters at your target companies. When you apply to a job, the person who posted it is often listed - follow that person.

**A - Alumni**
TechJoy graduates, university alumni, boot camp peers. You don't have to know them. Shared context builds trust fast.

**R - Relevant Communities**
Tech meetup organizers, Discord or Slack group members, open source contributors.

## The Personalization Formula

**Context + Relevance + Small Ask**

### Example
"Hi Kai, fellow TechJoy alum here. Saw your work on [specific project]. Would love to connect and follow your updates."

### Why It Works
- Shows you're not mass-messaging
- Creates immediate common ground
- Makes it easy to say yes

---

## Connection Request Best Practices

### Do's
- Reference something specific (their post, project, shared background)
- Keep it to 2-3 sentences
- Make the ask small ("would love to connect" vs "can you refer me")

### Don'ts
- Generic messages: "I'd like to add you to my professional network"
- Asking for referrals before building rapport
- Walls of text

---

## After They Accept: Nurturing the Connection

Once connected, don't let it go cold:
- Follow their posts
- React to and comment on their content
- Send a thank-you note for any help
- Share relevant articles or insights

**The goal:** Build genuine relationships, not transactional exchanges.

---

## Target Company Research Strategy

1. Search for the company on LinkedIn
2. Follow the company page
3. Click on "People" to see employees
4. Filter by role (recruiters, engineers, hiring managers)
5. Look for "Actively Hiring" badge
6. Connect with relevant people

### Pro Tips
- Look at profiles of people you admire
- Check their recommendations - those recommenders might work at companies that interest you
- You can send connection requests without a note when just building your network
- Once connected, you can often find their email for direct outreach

## Why Networking Matters

**70-85% of roles are filled through networking.**

### Employee Referral Programs
Most companies have referral bonuses ($200-$15,000). When your connections hear about open positions, they think of people they enjoyed working with.

### The Hidden Job Market
Many roles are never posted publicly. They're shared through internal referrals or recommendations.

### Referral Power
A referral gives you 4x higher chances of getting an interview.

## Mindset Shift

**Don't think:** "I need a job from this person."

**Do think:** "I want to learn about their work and build a genuine connection."

People love to talk about themselves. Approach them with curiosity about:
- Their role and contributions
- The company culture
- Projects they're working on

Through this avenue, you build relationships naturally. Then opportunities flow to you.
