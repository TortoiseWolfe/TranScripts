D&D Got Health WRONG
https://youtu.be/PRm6OBug_I4

What if the best way to make your D and
D combat unforgettable didn't come from
D and D at all? I'm sure you've had this
happen. Your barbarian charges forward
despite getting hit with four fireball
attacks, their great axe triumphantly
waving over their head, only for them to
end up rolling deaths because of one
last little goblin sticking them with
their rapier with a flipping toothpick.
Antilimactic, right? And sure, hit
points are simple. They're easy to
track, but are they really what you want
in your games? Do you want your players
to just scribble minus 12 hit points
without flinching? Or do you want them
to carry a scar, a limp, a story that
they'll be talking about for weeks? So,
I always thought hit points were fine. I
thought they were just kind of an
unavoidable part of RPGs that landed a
little more heavily on the G part of all
of it. But I was wrong. Like very wrong.
But luckily, that's where another system
came and showed me the lights. Because
here's the problem. In Dn D, nobody
really cares about HP until it's
dwindling down into the single digits.
Most of the time, losing hit points
means absolutely nothing, which is like
a jarring contrast to real life where
getting hit in the chest with an axe
would mean everything. And that
disconnect, that's why a lot of these
other fixes for combat, things like
faster pacing, cooler monster tactics,
clever win conditions, they all help,
but they don't solve the real problem,
and that's that your players aren't
immersed. They don't feel like they're
in danger. And that's where Tales from
Elsewhere's Clockworld comes in. Even
though Peter's a friend of mine and he
ran not one but two oneshots of his
system for me and some other D and D
YouTubers you might recognize. Despite
all this, today I'm still going to steal
from his brilliantly designed game.
Anyways, that's right. This is yet
another edition of Stealed This
Mechanic, the game show where I take
things I love from other games I play
and think about how I tinker with them
to put them into Dn D. Just fun little
experiments. a round of whatifs for us
game mechanic nerds out there. Now, the
Tales from Elsewhere system is more on
the grittier, slightly more deadly side
of the TTRPG spectrum, but not in the
usual low hit points, everyone dies fast
sort of way that we're kind of used to
with his game. Peter has made a strong
case for ditching HP entirely and
replacing it with wounds and conditions
instead. So, here's how it works.
Instead of a big pool of hit points,
you've got wound slots. For strain,
these are superficial grazes and
stresses. For serious injuries, these
are ones that slow you down but aren't
life-threatening. For critical injuries,
those are definitely for like uh-oh
moments. Uh that's a dangerous, more
severe sort of hit. And lethal injuries
are wounds that are immediately
lifethreatening. And things get extra
flavorful and intense with the Tales
from Elsewhere system because serious
and critical wounds, those buddies come
with conditions. In one of those games,
Bone Wizard took a serious wound, not
necessarily a big deal in itself, except
for it was specifically an arm injury,
and the condition he had as a result
wouldn't let him use his two-handed
weapon anymore. You know, the one our
survival basically depended on. And if
we hadn't dealt with that right away, we
probably wouldn't have survived the
encounter. And spoiler alert, if you
watched the replay, uh, one of us
didn't. Meanwhile though, something like
an unarmed cultist scratching at your
face, that's just strain. But even
strain stacks up over time, and enough
of it can snowball into more of a
serious injury. And let me tell you,
this system felt more immersive
immediately, more than hit points ever
had. But it did this all without using
wounds as a deterrent to get you as a
player to avoid combat, which is
definitely something I've experienced
with other systems that use more of
these wound and condition types of
mechanics. But this made it so that we
could still enjoy that part of the game.
But it was like combat suddenly had way
more teeth, sharp, pointy ones. And I
didn't feel like I was just waiting for
my turn. I was on the edge of my seat,
invested in every single hit that my
friends took. And of course, this is a
big departure from how Dn D works with
hit points, right? So, the real question
is, can we actually run something like
this in Dn D? Let's find out. Now,
obviously, there's way more to Peter's
system than just wounds and conditions.
His whole combat design is actually very
elegant. He's a dapper man. I'd expect
nothing less. But if you'd like to try
it for yourself, his fully funded
Kickstarter with mere days left to it
actually has a free play test dock and
the two oneshot adventures that he ran
for the group I was playing with. So you
can go to his Kickstarter and download
those. You can go to his channel and
watch the two oneshots. Whatever floats
your boat. Links are below. But here's
the thing. Dn D is pretty much married
to hit points. And not only that, it's a
highly heroic game. So, at first glance,
swapping in wounds doesn't feel like the
most natural fit, but I ain't scared,
Suge. If it were me, here's where I'd
start. And honestly, I want to hear from
you, too. This isn't something that I've
play tested yet. I'm just kind of
letting these ideas percolate a bit.
This is very thought experimenty, just a
sort of for fun kind of thing. So, drop
a comment and let me know how you drift
on this sort of idea. So, first things
first, we need to turn HP into wound
slots in Tales from Elsewhere. Everyone
starts with roughly the same amount of
wound slots, but in D and D, hit points
between classes vary wildly. So, we have
to account for those differences between
something like a barbarian and a squishy
little wizard. Not to mention that
there's feats, ancestry bonuses, all
that sort of stuff. So, there are a few
different ways I'm thinking about
tinkering with it. One option would be
to focus in on class flavor. So, you'd
want to figure out how many types of
each wound slot would make a barbarian
feel tanky versus a wizard feel fragile.
Another option I was considering is
having this be more of a point buy sort
of deal, almost similar to like stats.
You could take base HP and constitution,
then let players buy wound slots, maybe
trade them in as they level up. And if
scaling wound slots or seeing how many
fit for each class sounds like a lot to
you, I know not everyone enjoys play
testing, I think you could also consider
having a more flat across the board
style system like Tales from Elsewhere
has, and instead try implementing a
secondary system like negation slots. So
instead of scaling moon slots, you can
give classes a certain number of
negotiation slots to avoid the damage
entirely. Barbarians can flavor it as
shrugging off hits, paladins as
parrying, and wizards as making a lucky
dodge. And of course, if these ideas
seem overwhelming to you, I think even a
light version of all of this would
really bring a lot of flavor to the
table. So, you can skip reinventing the
HP system and instead just add two or
three wound slots as a separate track
entirely. That way, say maybe once PCs
are below half their HP, you can play
with more of these narrative injuries
and conditions with mechanical
consequences without overhauling the
entire system. Which, speaking of
damage, hit points and damage are
basically glued together in DD. So, how
do we rethink that if we're moving over
to wounds? Unfortunately, you can't just
copy tails from elsewhere one to one
here. But here's how I'd start. For nap
20s, I'd just have them instantly be
lethal to low-level enemies and minions.
For tougher monsters, it'd be an instant
critical and then maybe only a serious
wound for boss battles. For armor class,
we can keep it as is. And so ultimately,
we're really only swapping out what
happens after we hit. And since D and D
can have a wide damage range, I lean on
more threshold style rules. Think Dagger
Heart. So, a great sword rolling 2d6 has
more chances to land a low number, which
means a higher chance of getting a
critical wound. Perfect. Leave as is.
While a great axe with a d12 might look
like this, one to two on it would be a
critical injury. 3 to five is a serious
and six and over would be a strain. And
for monsters, you can tweak it a little
bit by roll. Simplify. So maybe minions
can only inflict a strain unless they
get a one and then it's a serious. But
for big scary bosses, every strike they
land might be a serious wound and then
maybe have the chance of being a
critical wound on a one. I think there's
a lot of room to play with it. So, be
flexible. And honestly, I'd love to hear
in the comments how you'd tune these
thresholds for your table. But
naturally, we also have to consider
things like resistances and
vulnerabilities. And luckily, these ones
slot right in. If your barbarian is
raging and resistant to piercing,
slashing, and budgeoning damage, any hit
in that wound gets downgraded. maybe
even say that they can only get strains
from these lower level attacks as a
class feature. But on the flip side,
vulnerabilities upgrade wounds. So if an
awakened shrub takes fire damage, that
strain would be bumped up to a serious
and a serious to a critical. Now, I know
all of this sounds like a really big
leap, but here's why it's worth playing
with. With this wound and condition
system, combat instantly feels more
dangerous. It feels more dramatic, and
it feels way more memorable. And that's
not just because of the wounds
themselves. That's the core. But it's
also because of this next thing.
Conditions are where this whole wound
thing really comes alive. Sure, you can
use D and D's existing conditions. You
can even port over the ones from Tales
from elsewhere and kind of see how you'd
fit those in. But honestly, what excites
me the most is the idea of inventing new
ones. Effects that make combat feel
unpredictable and dangerous. Picture
this. There's a pack of blink dogs
teleporting around the battlefield.
Maybe if two of them hit one PC, you can
introduce the overwhelmed condition. Now
that player rolls further attacks with
disadvantage, and if they crit fail,
they clip an ally in the process. Or
imagine a lightning bolt. Not only does
it knock you prone, but maybe it also
inflicts the electrocuted condition. If
you fail the save for this, you keep
taking strain every round until you make
the save. Maybe it even means adjacent
PCs are at risk of static electricity
jumps in some kind of area of effect
damage. And that's the beauty of wounds
with conditions. Every hit carries
suspense. It's not just you took damage.
It's, "Oh no, what else is about to
happen to me?" Now, of course, there's
the elephant in the room. Let's talk
healing. This is the other big place
you'd probably need to make a few more
tweaks for Dn D. In Tales from
Elsewhere, treating a wound doesn't
automatically clear the injury. It
clears the condition. That slot stays
locked out of the fight. But since Dn D
is so much more heroic, I think it's
reasonable that a potion or a spell
would clear the whole wound slot
completely, injury and all. So cure
wounds or healing word, they erase a
wound slot instead of restoring HP.
Spells that grant temporary HP, now they
grant a temporary wound slot. You could
even tie certain healing spells to
certain thresholds. Full roles might
clear critical or serious injuries.
Lesser rolls might only clear strain.
And by now you might be asking, why
bother with all of this extra work?
Here's why. What turns most people off
about combat in D and D isn't always
about the lack of speed or the
complexity. It's that it often doesn't
feel that interesting or immersive. A
hit should feel like a hit, not a casual
math problem. A wound system makes
combat much more storytelling forward.
And not just in the moment, but in the
scars, the strategies, and even in the
roleplay hooks that ripple out after
combat's over. It creates choices that
matter. It creates combat where you can
feel the tension all across the table,
and it makes your games unforgettable.
And our first Tales from Elsewhere game,
uh, crowd favorite, Gentle Jeff, a 6'
tall, 6 foot wide, 6 foot deep cube of a
man. He lost his leg in combat. Instead
of treating it like a punishment, Jason
leaned into it. For the next game, he
took a feat that gave him clockwork
parts. Suddenly, Jeff was clanking
around everywhere, and sneaking was no
longer really an option for him. And
that wasn't forced by the GM. It was a
story that Jason chose to tell as a
result, like what his character had been
through. In another game, my character
Marlo was impaled through the gut. She
was leaving a trail of blood that
Eldrich horrors could track. So, it
forced me to burn a precious item just
to increase my chances of survival.
That's what wounds do. They turn combat
into story. They force players to make
hard calls, and they create moments that
you remember long after the dice stop
rolling. For me as a DM, that's the
dream. a table full of possibility.
Terrifying possibility. So again, this
is just me spitballing. If you've
already got your own cool way of
tweaking hit points or replacing HP,
drop it down in the comments so I can
steal that, too. And yeah, I know it's a
big fundamental switch, but I do think
it'd be really cool to try something
like this for a short story arc, a
highstakes dungeon oneshot, or even just
a gritty little side quest. And
seriously, don't sleep on the Tales from
Elsewhere Kickstarter. There are just a
couple days left, so go grab your free
play test now. And as always, if you
