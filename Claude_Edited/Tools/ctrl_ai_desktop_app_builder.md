## What Is Ctrl?

An AI-native desktop environment where you describe what you need and get a working app — instantly. Everything runs locally. No cloud, no subscriptions. You own the code.

Every app includes:
- **SQLite database** — structured, queryable, local
- **AI assistant** (Cmd+J) — asks questions about YOUR data
- **Coding agent** — modify and extend apps with natural language

## How It Works

1. Describe your app in plain language (e.g., "habit tracker with daily check-ins, streaks, weekly overview")
2. AI designs the database schema and writes the full TypeScript application
3. Working app in ~2 minutes — no templates, real code

## Key Features

- **AI with database access** — the built-in assistant can read/write to your app's database directly (create entries, suggest data, modify records)
- **Diff-based editing** — AI shows precise content changes as diffs; accept individually or all at once
- **Desktop widgets** — live data from any app displayed on your desktop
- **Export/import** — package any app and move it between machines
- **Default apps included** — notes, projects, documents, bookmarks (all with AI assistance)

## Demo Apps Built

- Habit tracker, weather app (with real API), exercise tracker, chess with AI opponent, Wordle clone, stock tracker with live market data — each built in a few prompts

## Future Vision: Data Lake

All app data in a unified personal data layer — query across apps (projects + invoices together, habits + goals connected). Apps that understand each other.

## How It Differs from AI Code Generators

Most tools generate code then leave you to handle deployment, databases, and hosting. Ctrl provides the **complete environment** — apps run on your desktop with storage, widgets, and everything handled.
