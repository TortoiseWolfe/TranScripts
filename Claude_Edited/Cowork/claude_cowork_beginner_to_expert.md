## What Is Claude Cowork?

Claude Code but for everything — not just coding. Available in the Claude desktop app (Mac only). Requires Max plan ($100 or $200; $20 tier waitlisted).

| Tool | Role |
|------|------|
| **Claude** (claude.ai) | Researcher — does research |
| **Claude Code** | Developer — writes and runs code |
| **Claude Cowork** | Employee — does everything (research, code, files, browser, documents, presentations) |

**Key differentiator:** Cowork controls your computer, manipulates documents, controls your browser, has its own virtual environment, and works autonomously. Like hiring someone with their own computer.

## Four Use Cases

### 1. File Organization

**Prompt:** "Go into this downloads folder, take all the images and screenshots, and put them into a new Images folder. Organize that images folder any way you want."

**Result:**
- Found 369 image files
- Created 10 subfolders: duplicates, thumbnails, photos, miscellaneous, web downloads, AI generated, design projects, logos, screenshots, GIFs
- Actually opened images to understand content before categorizing
- Tracked progress via built-in to-do list (visible in sidebar)

### 2. Media Kit / Presentation Creation

**Prompt:** "I have a newsletter with 40,000 subs called Ship It Weekly. Please go to my newsletter site alexfinn.ai and research it, then make a media kit presentation for me that I can send to potential sponsors."

**Result:**
- Used **web search connector** to research the actual live site
- Created full PowerPoint presentation with: about section, newsletter highlights, subscriber stats (40K subs, 45% open rate, 8% CTR), sponsorship tiers, contact info
- Pulled real data from the website
- ~4 minutes total

**Key capabilities demonstrated:**
- **Live web access** — can search and retrieve current information (unlike claude.ai)
- **Claude Skills integration** — uses the skill system from Claude Code
- **Artifact creation** — documents, slideshows saved locally

### 3. Subscription Audit / Financial Management

**Prompt:** "Go through my credit statement and make a spreadsheet of all subscriptions I have, then make a column for the cost and a column explaining how to unsubscribe. Let me know how much I'd save by unsubscribing to everything."

**Input:** Credit card statement PDF (dragged in)

**Result:**
- Identified all recurring subscriptions
- Created spreadsheet with: subscription name, monthly cost, how-to-unsubscribe instructions
- Total found: $16,000/year in subscriptions
- Discovered forgotten subscriptions (WordPress $100/month, Elementor $64, World of Warcraft from 5 years ago)
- ~3 minutes total

### 4. App Idea Validation + PRD Generation

**Prompt:** "I have an app idea: 3D AI agent manager like a RTS game. Run it through full validation — research competitors, analyze the market, identify strengths and weaknesses. Then create a professional PRD document with charts and tables including: target user, core user loop, MVP scope, tech stack, timeline, naming/domain suggestions, launch strategy, and a Claude Code starter prompt."

**Result:**
- Full market analysis with TAM
- Competitive landscape
- SWOT analysis
- 14-page PRD with: target users, core features, MVP scope, tech stack, timeline
- **Claude Code starter prompt** — copy/paste to start building immediately
- All saved locally as a document

## Interface Features

- **Sidebar to-do list** — agent creates and tracks its own task list
- **Artifacts panel** — shows all created documents, spreadsheets, presentations
- **Context panel** — shows which folder/files it's working with
- **Multi-task** — kick off another task while one is running

## Getting Started Advice

Practice 10 minutes daily for a week. If you don't know what to ask, just say: **"Hey, this is my day. How can you help with this?"** Spin up tasks, come back later, review the output.
