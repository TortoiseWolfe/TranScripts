# Trading Plan

## Rules

1. **Risk per trade**: Max 1-2% of account balance
2. **Stop loss**: Always set before entry. No trade without a stop.
3. **Take profit**: Minimum 1:1.5 risk-to-reward ratio
4. **Max open positions**: 2 at a time (while learning)
5. **Session focus**: London-NY overlap (8 AM - 12 PM ET) for best liquidity

## Entry Criteria

- Identify the trend on daily chart (higher highs/lows or lower highs/lows)
- Wait for pullback to support/resistance level
- Confirm with candlestick pattern (pin bar, engulfing, inside bar)
- Check that stop loss is at a logical level (beyond recent swing high/low)

## Exit Criteria

- Take profit hit → close position
- Stop loss hit → close position, no moving stops to avoid loss
- End of week → close any positions open over the weekend (while learning)

## Pairs Traded

- Focus on major pairs from watchlist only
- No exotic pairs until consistently profitable on majors

## Review Schedule

- Daily: Quick journal entry after each trade
- Weekly: P&L review, pattern analysis (Friday evening cron)
- Monthly: Trading plan review and rule adjustments

## Notes

- This is a learning plan. Rules will evolve as skills develop.
- Paper trading only — no real money until consistent profitability over 3+ months.
