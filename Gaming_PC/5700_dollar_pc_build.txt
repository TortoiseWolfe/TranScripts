$5,700 PC Build
https://youtu.be/6c49Op7kvZw

Today's a big day. We're going to get
our new PC. This is my current PC right
now. It's a 3080 with a Ryzen 9. I
bought it in 2022. I think I made a
video on it. Everything I had this PC
built for MicroEnter and I paid about
$4,000 for it. But this PC is nothing
compared to what we're getting today.
And this is the PC we're getting today.
It's from Micro Center as well. They
didn't build it for us. The CPU is a
Ryzen 9 950 3D ASUS motherboard. It's 64
gigs of RAM. Has a 5080 8 TB of SSD, 16
TB of hard drive. The case looks so nice
with this. The case has a whole screen
on and everything. Power supply is a
1600 watt. The water cooling is this.
The ASUS road. I don't know how to
pronounce that, but yeah, it was $400.
The total price $5,700.
>> Yeah, it's a lot of money and that's why
I haven't bought it yet. I've been
debating about buying this for like 3
months and a couple days ago, I finally
pulled the trigger. My older brother
lives close to Microsenter. So, he
ordered the PC for me and now the PC is
fully built and he has at his house. So,
in this video, we're going to get the PC
for my brother's house and we're going
to build a gaming setup at his house and
he lives close to the servers and he has
fiber internet. So, we might get zero
pain. Let's see. This is my current
setup right now. I get 25 to 30 ping and
my wire management sucks.
Holy crap. But I'm not going to lie,
these play buttons are literally
carrying the room. When people come to
my room, they care more about these play
buttons than my PC. These play buttons
will definitely raise my marriage. So,
thank you guys so much. I needed this.
But yeah, today we're under to my
brother's house. My brother's 31 years
old and he has a wife. Him and his wife
just live in that house alone. I'm
probably just going to stay there for
like a week or two to test out the
Wi-Fi. After like a week or two, I'm
definitely coming back to the motel to
help my parents.
By the way, this is not my car. It's my
dad's BMW. I did give him a little bit
of money to buy this, but it's not mine.
If I do ever buy a car, you know for
sure I'm making a video on it.
I'm going to learn from my mistake and
not show my brother's house. Some people
will just find it and it's like really
scary when people know where you live.
>> So, this is the house.
This is lowkey nice couches. I don't
know what the heck he's watching.
Living room, kitchen,
and this is going to be my bed probably.
It's the PC right here. Oh my god, it's
heavy. In the basement is where we're
going to make this head up.
And this is probably where I'm going to
put the setup. Let's open this
after literally tearing apart the box.
The PC is right there. The PC after
everything ended up being $6,200. This
is a receipt. I don't know if I got a
scam. Someone let me know.
>> This is the PC. Now we got to set
everything up.
>> A few minutes later,
>> fully completed. I think the wire
management is a little better. I don't
know how to fix all these wires though.
I have this little cable thing that
fixes it into better. And now let's turn
the PC on. Really excited.
Uh
oh, I forgot. Got to turn this on. Now
it'll work.
>> Embarrassing.
>> Turns out these plugs don't have power.
Dang it. So I have to put them over
there, I think. I don't know. I just
ended up using a power sender and it
worked.
>> Now the PC should turn on. Let's turn it
on, bro.
>> Wait.
Do this. Now it should turn on.
Holy crap.
It's so quiet.
It's so quiet. I don't know if you can
hear this.
My other PC was so loud. This is like
the most quiet thing ever. This PC in
the BIOS has a bunch of AI stuff like AI
overclocking and stuff like that, but
I'm like super scared to turn it on. I
don't want to break it. I only turned on
this AI overclock tuner. This is what I
had on my old PC as well. I turned it to
Expo One and then I just made my memory
like 6,000. That's what my uh speed is
on my RAM. That's all I've done. All
right, I'm going to download everything
and get all set up now.
>> I forgot to do the touchcreen.
I just had to plug these two cables in.
They were on my PC and now I can use the
faces. I put macros on it theme. I want
to make it cool, man. I ended up doing
like Attack on Titan theme and this is
what my PC looked like. And I made this
Attack on Titan. It's kind of Attack on
Titan theme. I don't know. I need to get
a better picture for that. But yeah,
it's pretty easy to set up. It's like a
app that you put in. You just put
whatever picture you want to do and
yeah, you can put that on the screen.
It's pretty cool. I guess at the house I
was doing like 500 download and like 300
upload. That was on Wi-Fi, too. I
couldn't get the Ethernet set up. I'm
I'm probably going to buy like a Wi-Fi
center with the Ethernet port and then
use Ethernet from it.
>> 400 megabytes download. Oh, this is
Yeah, this is the final setup at the
house. This is way better than last
time. And now the most important thing.
Let's check out our FPS in Fortnite and
our ping. All right, so my guess is I'm
going to get 1,000 FPS and 15 ping. I'm
still on Wi-Fi, so I don't think I'm
gonna get like anything under 10. But
yeah, that's my guess. Let's try it. And
then east. It says 19 ping and central.
It says 19 ping. So both 19 ping.
Central and east. So we're on
uh 500 to 700 FPS and we're on 15. It's
the same thing, which isn't bad.
Yeah, which isn't really bad. When I get
the Wi-Fi sender and Ethernet through
it, I think I'll get like maybe 10 ping.
I'm meeting the Wi-Fi sender tomorrow.
The ping is actually really
inconsistent. Sometimes I get like 15
ping and sometimes I get like four
How is that kid unreal?
This feels so good. Like I'm on four
ping somehow. I don't know. The ping is
like really inconsistent. Sometimes I'd
be on 10 ping in creative but like five
ping like in game. Doesn't make sense.
Heat.
Heat.
Last guy.
Edit.
Let's go. It feels like literally
creative. The PC and everything feels
really good. The only problem is you
could probably tell by my voice. It's
like a really big room. My voice has
like an echo in it. That's why my
voice's entire video just sounds really
bad. I actually moved myself from the
basement to another room. But even this
room is pretty big and it still has an
echo. I don't know where else to move
this. I might just have to move back to
motel.
