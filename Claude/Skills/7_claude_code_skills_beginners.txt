The biggest problem with vibe coding as
a non-engineer is that you don't
actually know what makes code good. And
if it isn't good, it means it's going to
break all the time. It's not going to be
scalable. It's not going to be testable.
It's going to be ugly. And no one's
going to want to use it. And I get it. A
lot of beginners think clawed code on
its own is enough to build things that
are great. But here's the trap. By
default, language models do not write
good code. They write plausible code
based on what they've read. And
plausible code turns into bugs, horrible
UX, and things people don't want to use.
So, in this video, I'm going to break
down my seven piece clawed skill stack
that allows you to package engineering
expertise into your project. Now, before
we start by getting into skill number
one, I want to spend about 15 seconds
giving you a rundown of where you should
actually use Claude skills and not
something else. So, a basic mental model
is this. Custom commands are basically
just like reusable prompts. If you have
a sequence of steps that you find
yourself consistently prompting and copy
pasting into the model you're using,
just write that into a custom command.
Now, sub agents are like mini instances
of claude code that operate within their
own context window. So, they are really
good at solving very specific problems
by having a context window that is for
that specific problem. But skills allow
us to give specific expertise to our
agent and then we can use that expertise
inside of our main context window. So,
I'll have a prompt below the video here
if you want it that actually helps you
decide if what you're intending to do
should be a sub agent or if it should be
a skill depending on what it is exactly
that you are doing because they are
useful in different situations. So, the
first skill we're going to talk about is
actually published by Anthropic and it
is their front-end design skill. So,
probably the most complained about thing
that I hear about from subscribers is
that they really struggle with the
aesthetics of their app and the user
experience. So, basically, in any
context where you aren't just cloning an
existing design from someone like
Airbnb, from a tool like Mobin, it can
become very difficult to build something
that actually looks really nice. And so,
this front-end design skill is supposed
to be a simple way for us to get around
that. and it does it by giving the agent
very specific directions about what the
skill of UI design is even about. So,
we're going to start off by actually
getting access to this first plugin. And
we do that by typing /plugin and then
going down to the clawed plugins
official. Browse the plugins and then we
can choose the front-end design plugin
and we can install it here in our
project. So, what we have here is a very
basic thumbnail design tool that I have
been using that I built with Nano Banana
Pro. And obviously, it looks a little
bit stale. And so, I want to come down
and I want to see if we can actually use
this front-end design tool with a very
simple prompt to make it pop. Now, these
skills are typically automatically
invoked by the system, but you can just
tell it to use the skill as well. So,
I'm going to give it a very simple
prompt. I'm going to say, "Use this
front-end design skill. Help me revamp
the front-end design." It should use
these libraries. The general feel should
be like tech forward yet kind of
Spartan. So, kind of like a Tesla
interior, but with pops of color and
kind of ease on the eyes like you would
get with a tool like Claude. All right,
guys. So, that just finished up
frontend design skill, and I ran through
a prompt here. So, it's looking pretty
nice compared with what it looked like
before. There's still a few little
things I think that I would want to
tighten up here. If we go in and look at
the actual like gallery, they changed
the entire gallery view. They did this
nice little hover animation. Obviously,
some of these buttons need to be kind of
fixed. This should be inverted the other
way. But if we were to like actually
click on one of these, again, this looks
really nice, really tight. And then nice
editor workflow that it built out for us
here with some nice little UI elements.
So, for a very basic prompt, which
again, I didn't dial in at all. This is
ideally something that you would dial
in, right? This is a beginner or like a
starter prompt, but you can come in and
you can make this your own, infuse it
with your own design principles, all of
that good stuff. And I really like what
they did with the setting page. So, with
this skill, that consistent struggle of
trying to make UI that actually like
conforms to your plan should be a thing
of the past. And now we can move into
our second skill which is actually the
skill of writing skills but for code
specifically. So as you start realizing
how powerful these skills are the next
logical or natural question becomes hey
can I build these things myself based on
what I do and my structures and my
processes. And like anything there are
good ways to build the skills and there
are bad ways to build the skills. So
luckily the author of my favorite skill
library superpowers has a skill that is
specifically for writing skills that are
good for claude code. And so what's
interesting about how they approach it
in this repository is they basically say
creating skills is much like creating
tests. And so it has this analogy from
test driven development and where that
kind of maps onto this skill creation
process. And so there's a lot of details
in here. You can go and read it. But
what we're going to do is we're going to
hop in and we're going to actually
create one. So I will clear out my
context. Again, you would want to go
into your plugins and you would want to
go over to marketplaces. In this case,
it is the Ora superpowers marketplace.
You would want to browse the plugins and
then from here you'll be able to pick
the superpowers library which is where
this is going to actually live. Say for
example that we want to create a skill
to use inside of cloud code that is
specifically for writing change logs.
And so we want it to be that anytime we
maybe make a major feature addition or
change something meaningful that it
creates a change log which could be
developer focused or customer focused
and it creates that automatically based
on this skill being called. So what we
can do is we can use this superpower for
writing skills to help us actually make
this thing. Now in this case I already
have one but I could just say hey I want
to delete that one and start from
scratch. And so what it's going to do is
it's going to go through and it is going
to create me a fresh skill and delete
the other one that I had. All right. So
now that that thing is done and it
created this change log generator skill
for us, we can simply come through and
we could ask it to create us a change
log. And now we can see that this change
log generator skill is being used. And
this is obviously something that would
happen automatically, but in this case,
just to show you guys, we're going to
generate it manually. And I'm telling it
to look through the last five commits
from this project and then based on what
it finds there, generate me a change log
entry. And so there we have it out the
other side, a really basic change log,
which obviously we could ramp this thing
up and amp it up and make it a lot
better. But the point wasn't the change
log. The point was we have this new
skill where we can create Claude code
specific skills very easily on our own.
So, the next one up on the list is
actually a bit of a bonus skill because
it's an entire library of my favorite
skills. So, what we're looking at here
is a repository called Obra Superpowers.
And so, this is an entire library of
Claude Code specific skills. And I know
it sounds a bit crazy to say, but it
really has changed my perspective
entirely when it comes to how I work
with Claude Code. and I'm going to show
you a few of the skills that are the
reason why that's the case. So, inside
of this repository, there's a few core
skills that are really awesome. The
first is the brainstorming skill. And
so, what this does is anytime you set
out to do some new work like creating a
feature, adding functionality, making a
major modification, it triggers this
skill. And what this skill does is it
really breaks down the process of really
understanding the idea, coming up with
different fundamental approaches to
solving it and then presenting you some
sort of design documentation specifying
how it thinks you should proceed. And
from there you can use the next skill
which is writing plan. So these things
hook together where we go from the
brainstorming stage, we approve the
design and then we jump directly into
writing out an actual step by step plan
for implementing this new thing that we
are building. Now there's a ton of other
skills that they have access to that you
can go in and check out. I love the
systematic debugging skill, but I'm
going to hop in and show you guys how we
can use these brainstorming and plan
writing skills. So let's say for example
we came in and we were like hey I want
to build this new feature that uses the
user's performance data for the
thumbnails like the click-through rate
the impressions and everything like that
and it uses that to train future
thumbnail generation so that we can get
data driven thumbnail generations from
this tool that we've been building or
updating. And so we can see immediately
what it does is it's actually triggering
this brainstorming skill right off the
bat. And so it's going to start off with
asking us a few questions about the
fundamental approach that we should be
taking. So in this case, I want manual
entries of this data. YouTube doesn't
actually expose a lot of this data
through their API. So outside of
scraping it, this is going to be my best
option. And then we're going to continue
moving through and just answering the
base questions that it has. And so
again, the reason that I love this skill
is it's asking us a lot of really good
questions that were clearly ambiguous
based on what our ask was. So, I said,
"Hey, I want to be able to use a user's
performance data to trigger better
thumbnails in the future." Well, there's
a lot of things we need to hash out
based on that, like, where is the data
going to actually come from? How is this
even going to get entered into the
system and used? How should it influence
future generations of thumbnails? What
are the actual criteria that determine a
top performer? In this case, it's going
to be the actual click-through rate. How
many get sent through in each
generation? And again, for all of these,
it's giving us trade-offs, right? If we
put too many images in, it's going to
use a lot more tokens. So, it's going to
be more costly. And so, we're just
moving through and answering all of
these questions one by one. So, once
this is complete and it's gone through,
it's asked us all the questions. Now,
it's going to move through and make sure
we are on board with the breakdown of
what it is going to build. So, it goes
from the feature overview, the core
flows, the key constraints, making sure
we're on board with all of that. Same
thing with the changes that are going to
be needed to our data model. How the
actual API integration is going to work,
how the UI is going to actually support
this thing we're building, how the
settings and the user controls are going
to change, and then how we are going to
handle edge cases and errors. So, it's
making sure that we're on board with all
of this stuff. And then from there, we
are now invoking automatically this
writing plans skill. And so again, it's
going to have a really structured way of
moving through the codebase, documenting
what we're going to do, and then
actually writing a plan that we can
implement against. So now that that
skill is complete, we have this
comprehensive plan detailing everything
that we would need to do in order to go
build this feature. And when I say
comprehensive, I mean it is actually
quite long. It has all the testing in
there, everything that we would need to
go out and actually build this thing.
So, if you're someone that is trying to
vibe code with direction and a system
behind you, this entire skill library I
think is a bit of a no brainer. So, next
up on the list for anybody that ever
said prompt engineering is dead, clearly
doesn't actually build stuff that needs
good prompting. And so this prompt
engineering skill is great if you are
someone that's building apps that
actually relies on calling model
providers in order to do stuff. So what
we're going to do here is we're going to
ask it to use the prompt engineering
pattern skill that we just looked at to
analyze my Gemini calls and provide
recommendations for how we can actually
fix things. And so here it is. It's
calling the skill and then it should
generate us a report explaining how we
could optimize our prompting. So after
this thing has run through, we can see
that it has a bunch of recommendations
for us about how we are actually running
our main generation prompt and some of
the issues that are there and the
severity meaning like what we could do
to actually or rather what the priority
of the problem is and giving us very
clear recommendations for how to improve
it. So my current prompt under the hood
actually looks like that where it's
relying a lot on this user prompt that
comes through when in reality we could
get much better outputs more
consistently if we changed our prompt to
something more like this more
structured. And then that same approach
applies to a few other areas. So this is
all great because these are all things
that would really meaningfully make this
app better. And this is for something
that's pretty straightforward, which is
a basic image generation workflow. But
obviously, sky is the limit with
something like this. So skills like this
one are exactly why I say that skills
themselves are one of the best releases
since sliced bread because we can take
serious expertise from other people and
in this case it's how to prompt engineer
properly and then we can extend our own
agents with that knowledge in order to
make all of the stuff that we build just
that much better. And the next skill on
the list is really no different because
we start getting into API design. So
what we can do with this skill is that
we can use it to help design our backend
APIs in a way that does not stank. And
so what we're going to do again is we're
going to come down here into this
project which doesn't actually have a
REST API. And what I'm going to do is
I'm going to ask it to plan out an
approach to actually migrate it to a
REST API. And so what we can see is that
it's now using this specific plug-in for
back-end development and it's calling
the API design principles skill. And so
it's going to use this to actually
explore my entire codebase and then
decide what changes to make and how it
would actually migrate this app to using
a REST API. And so this one is super
useful because as our agent or our sub
agents begin any back-end API work, we
could configure it to actually invoke
these skills. And what that means is
anytime it goes to do this backend API
work, it's going to have a bunch of
great context and ways of working
automatically injected into the
definition of the agent at the time that
it starts running. And this is why when
people say that they think AI is going
to replace coders and engineers, I kind
of just laugh because we are always
going to need people that can build out
this type of expertise so that everybody
else can actually use it and implement
it in order to build things that are
objectively better. So now we can see we
have a pretty robust migration plan that
would take us from our current state
where we are through to a fully
implemented REST API full with all of
the endpoints, the user models, all of
the data models, everything that would
need to be there in order to make this
transition happen. And it is very very
detailed. I think they even built a job
queue architecture in. So a very awesome
thing that we got out of this skill. So
again, another highly recommended
especially for vibe coders that want to
be able to do things the right way. And
again, these skills can be invoked
inside of your sub agents. And there's
really a ton of awesome stuff that you
can do. And so this next one up on the
list goes hand in hand with the last one
and really doubles down on that idea of
why we will always need people that are
absolute experts in something to help
create these skills so that if we are
vibe coding, we're doing things well.
and we're not doing stuff that is just
dumb. And so what we're talking about is
Postgres table design. So this was one
of those skills that really helped
solidify for me how valuable these
skills are really going to be because in
this case we can again make sure that
when we are working with Supabase for
example that we aren't doing things that
we really should not be doing that are
going to create serious problems when we
start to scale the database and get
users and all of that stuff. And so what
we could do to demonstrate this is we
could think about this plan that we just
made for the REST API. And we could
first clear out the context here and we
could tell the system to use the
Postgres table design skill and update
our REST API migration plan based on the
Postgres skills, right? And then we
could link to that plan. And so now it's
going to take that API migration plan
and it's going to make sure that it's
conforming to all of the best practices
that are laid out within this skill. And
so now that this skill is finished
processing, we can see that there were a
lot of updates that were made to that
migration plan when it comes to a bunch
of different pieces of the database
table design. And we can see that we
have these other sections that were
actually generated that are now at the
end of this plan which we could move in
and we could see exactly what was made.
So pretty awesome. And again taking our
project and elevating it beyond just
some basic thing and starting to move it
into that realm where it would actually
have some sort of place in a real world
application. All thanks to Claude
skills. And so this is another skill
that I think you'd be a fool not to use
as a vibe coder. But we will move on to
the last one, but definitely not the
least one, the error handling skill. So
error handling obviously very important.
No denying that. But error handling well
not only helps you, but it really helps
the language models actually perform
better. when you have much more
contextual and sensible errors that you
can give it, you end up fixing things a
lot faster and it's just a much better
workflow overall. And so what this skill
does is it actually helps us do that. So
it prompts for some distinct
philosophies on how to actually handle
errors the right way. It categorizes the
different types of errors. And then it
actually gives language specific error
handling advice, which is good for me
because I use Python and JavaScript
primarily. And that is what the error
handling conventions are that we have
inside of this doc. And then it breaks
down a bunch of patterns that are really
helpful to know that you would
potentially want in your app depending
on what you're doing like circuit
breakers and a bunch of other cool
things. So the way that we could use
this is again to hop back into our
project. And so what we could ask it to
do in this case is to look at our
frontend hooks and then I want you to
use the error handling skill to improve
error handling in those files. So these
are all the files that are responsible
for how we do like the actual character
generation and the edits and storing
characters and doing all of that stuff.
And so now that this skill is running,
we can see that it's already moving
along and recommending us updates. So
it's creating a shared error utility
that all of these hook patterns are
going to actually use. And then it's
going to move through and it's going to
actually start improving the patterns
that we're using to actually log these
errors, which again is going to make our
life a hell of a lot easier. So there
you have it, guys. My seven skill Claude
Code stack that I use on a weekly basis.
Just remember, skills give your agents
specialized expertise and so you would
be a fool not to use them. Now, there's
a ton of other skills out there that I
didn't have time to cover, but even
these seven alone will really improve
the quality of what you build. So, get
out there and start building stuff with
these skills and let me know how it
goes. I've got a free Vibe Coding
community in the description below where
I post all of my YouTube files and
prompts, templates, and workflows. You
can go check that out and share the type
of stuff that you have been building.
That is it for this video. I will see
you in the next.
