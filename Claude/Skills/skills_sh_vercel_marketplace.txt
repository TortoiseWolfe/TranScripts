Today I want to share a bit about
something I've been playing around with
for the last few days and this is skills
the open AI agent ecosystem. This is the
skills.sh.
This is from Versel and basically if
you don't know what skills is, this is a
way you can kind of level up your AI
agents. So if you look at the Claude
codes interpretation of this, this is
extend Claude with skills. create,
manage, and share skills to extend
cloud's capabilities include code
includes custom slash commands and stuff
like that. So, basically, it's a simple
way to upgrade your agents for whatever
use case you have. So, you can think of
it like it's like in between like an MCP
server, but it's a bit more different.
I'm not going to go into kind of exactly
how skills work in this video. I'm just
going to showcase the new marketplace or
ecosystem from Versel here. So if you
scroll down a bit, you can see here are
kind of where we can download or reuse
other people's skills they have created.
So you can see versel react best
practices. This is the most installed
for this is a bit more based on kind of
the front end part. So you can see we
have web design guidelines 18,000
downloads. Then we have remotion. We're
going to try that out. So basically what
I want to do, I want to try to update my
web page using these two skills from
Versel here. And I want to try some
simple video editing with remote skill.
So basically you can see all we have to
do install in one command npx skills add
and just the repo here. So let's try it
out and see what this can do for us. And
like I said I will be using cloud code
for this. Okay so this is kind of my
code base for this website now. Right.
So we have the NPC my creative agents
video agents website. You can see it's
looked pretty good, but I kind of want
to make maybe add some dark mode, maybe
some smoother animations. We'll see what
we can do. So, you can see now we're
just going to head back here. And, you
know, we need this MPC skills command.
So, I'm just going to paste in run this
command. And I think we want to install
two of these. Yeah, we want to install
this, right? So this is super easy. But
remember, we also want to along with the
best practices, we also want to install
the web interface guidelines. So I'm
also going to copy this command. I'm
going to head back to cloud code. But
first let's finish installing this. Here
you can see we can see the skills and we
got that. Okay. So we installed those
and next is going to be the the web
design guidelines skills. Okay. That was
done. So I think we need to restart
claw code now. So I'm just going to exit
clear and I'm going to do claw again. Go
into this. So if we do slash skills now
you can see we have those two skills.
Versel react best practices, web design
guidelines. This is project based
skills. So this is not global and that's
what I wanted. Right? So now that we
have these skills, I want to make a
prompt to actually take use of these
skills. So if we go back to cursor now,
you can now see we have something called
claude here and we have skills and here
we can see we have versel and we have
the web design. So we click on versel,
we go to skills.md. Here we kind of have
the full overview. So you can see we
have a bunch of information. Claude can
look up here. Rendering performance,
JavaScript performance. We can switch
over to web design skill.md. And again
it kind of refers to this file here. So
this is a file we can fetch fresh
guidelines before each review. Something
we can do right. So this is kind of the
way when we do this MPX install or
skills, we get this into our cloud
skills and we can kind of refer to this
here. So yeah, works pretty smooth. So
remember the skills we kind of upgraded
this agents to now is kind of to follow
the best practices and the web design
guidelines from Versel. So I'm just
going to say I already have a working
Versel stack page. Explore the codebase.
Please use best practices to update this
page. Also, I want the page to have a
dark team option and some smooth
animations. So, when I click enter now,
hopefully we can see that Claude code or
this agent now decides to use some of
the skills we already have installed
here. But you can see first it's going
to explore the code base and then I'm
going to take you back if I see Claude
code choosing here to use some of the
skills we kind of have upgraded this
agent to. Okay. So you can see now it
kind of loaded up a couple of skills. So
this is the versel react best practices
web design guidelines and now it's going
to yeah let me see what happens. So it's
going to read this agents.md file.
We're going to fetch something here. So
we can look at some web interface
guidelines from versel labs. Okay that's
fine. So I'm just going to let this run
and see what kind of how we're going to
use these skills and how this is going
to be implemented into our web page
here. So you can see now it's kind of
working on the dark team. It's going to
look at some prefers reduced motion.
Okay. So basically hopefully now it's
just going to look at the page we have
do some updated or upgrades based on
kind of the skills we gave it and then
we're going to see how this look
afterwards. So you can see after kind of
running the review here of the full page
based on kind of the guidelines from the
skills we have some issues here we can
try to fix. So on line 7 37 15. Yeah,
you kind of get the point. This is kind
of what this skill is about. And now you
can see cloud code is working on these
issues kind of based on the guidelines
from the skill package we installed. So
yeah, I think we are done with the dark
mode and now we're just going to do this
and let's take a look at the final
result. So yeah, we have updated all the
pages for dark mode. Now, let's just go
here and let's start the page again. So,
mpm rundev and we're going to open up
this in an external browser. And let's
see. Now, we should have the dark mode,
right? All right. This looks pretty
good. And yeah, animations feels pretty
smooth like they did before. I don't see
any big changes, but I like the dark
mode. Let's try to switch to light.
Okay, seems to work pretty good. So, is
this persistence now? If you go to
pricing, yeah, that kind of brings the
dark mode over. What about the blog
page? Good. Signin page. Yeah, still
dark mode. And what if we switch? All
right, so that was pretty easy. Did this
make like a big change? I'm not quite
sure, but we at least got the dark mode
working and it's looking pretty smooth.
So, of course, I would have follow up
with do this on mobile and stuff like
that, but I'm not going to skip that
now. And yeah, like a super easy way to
kind of get sure or make sure that if
you wanted to, you kind of have all the
Versel React best practices. Of course,
this is very specific to this stack. And
we have some web design guidelines that
can also be nice to follow if you're
building on Versel like most of my
projects are. But now I want to move on
to Remotion. So Remotion is kind of a
way you can edit videos by using code.
And this is something I really like to
do. So I'm kind of excited to see what
we can actually do with remotion and
cloud code and using code to animate and
edit video. Okay. So what I have done
now is I went into remotion right. I
installed this MPX skills here and you
can see here are kind of all the
markdown files. So these are the rules,
calculations, everything we need to kind
of use remote in the best practices. So
these are kind of referring to different
market files. So if we go to cursor now
and we go under cloud skills remote best
practices what we installed and we look
at the skill MD file you can see these
are kind of referring to all of these
different pages so Claude can fetch so
this could be rules for 3D assets fonts
everything here right so that's pretty
good so what I want to do now is I have
two different clips the first clip is
basically me just talking about the
intro for this video for example 12
seconds and I have like some B-roll
something like that this is just me
scrolling over this skill page so I want
to try to use remote now to kind of edit
this video add some cool transitions
maybe some animations some captions and
see how that goes so what I'm going to
do is I headed over to cloud code in
this directory and now I want to start
trying to edit this videos using
remotion. Okay, so I think I have a plan
now. I'm going to read this but you can
skip ahead. So basically what we want to
do, we have the two clips skills 1.mp4
and b-roll.mp4. The video is about an
intro to skills to understand the clips.
We want to use ffmpeg to get the audio
to mp3. Then we want to use a local
whisper model to get the SRT file. This
is the transcription and the timestamps.
And when you have this, you can find the
best place to insert a B-roll clip and
also add captions to the video and some
smooth animations. Create a plan for
this. So, I'm going to go to plan mode
and create a plan for how we're going to
execute all of these tasks. So,
hopefully now Claude can with Remotion
and FFmpeg and Whisper fully edit my
video. So, I have it ready with all the
animations, captions, everything we need
in kind of one go. So I'm going to take
you back when we have the plan and then
see if we can actually execute on this
plan. So we can see now Claude is
actually using the skills here. So it's
looking at remotion best practices,
rules, videos, animations, audio, and I
found some important best practices from
the skills. Let me update the plan to
correct the remote patterns. All of this
looks pretty good. So this kind of could
save us some time. if we kind of have
all the skills are updated and the
documentation is updated. This will kind
of help us saving some time and maybe
get some better results. So, I think the
plan is almost ready now after we kind
of looked at the last set of skills we
learned and see if we can actually edit
this video. So, I'm just going to accept
this plan now. And hopefully now Claude
is just going to start working on this
task we gave it. And I'm not going to
touch anything. I'm not going to do any
interventions now. I'm just want to see
if the plan if this plan works first
time and hopefully we get good results
with the B-roll added on top of our
footage and some captions and some
animations. Okay, so here comes the
exciting part now. So you can see we
should be ready to test this. So I'm
just going to say run npm run dev for
me. And hopefully now we have like a
fully edited video only done with
whisper ffmpeg and remotion used by cloud
code. Okay, so you can see we popped up
into their editor and right away this
looks pretty good. You can see we have
the captions. So let me turn off my mic
and let's play the 12 second clip.
Today we are taking a look at versel
skills.sh. This is where you can kind of
upgrade or level up your agents like
cloud code. So let's take a look at it
and see how we can actually use this in
practice. Okay, that wasn't too bad,
right? We kind of you can see I'm going
to turn off the sound here. So we got
the captions. They look fine. We could
have done some more editing on those if
we wanted to. And you can see at 8
seconds or something, we switch to the
B-roll. And I guess that's fine. Maybe
we could have done that earlier. Maybe
we can done it at 2 seconds. But other
than that, that looks pretty good. And I
think there's much more we could do with
this. So let's ask for some more
engaging or attention editing just to
see what happens. So I'm just going to
say great job. We need the editing to be
more engaging, more to keep the people's
attention. Do your best. So, I'm going
to leave it like with an open-ended goal
and let's see what kind of editing here
now Claude Code can do with the remote
skills and stuff like that and see if we
can make it a bit more interesting. So,
I went ahead I asked Claude if they can
do some sound effects. So, it suggested
I should go ahead and create all of
these sound effects. So, I did that. I
just put them in this audio here audio
folder. So, now we have the six sound
effects. So, I'm just going to refer to
that and let's see if it can add it. I
just added all the effects in audio and
now I want to see if it adds all these
effects into the final clip. So, I'm
going to render the clip and then we're
going to play it to see if it's more
engaging that what we had the first time
around. So, I just said here render the
clip save to CVD and now we are kind of
rendering. You can see here we are
rendering the clip and this should be
saved and then we're going to open it
and let's play it in kind of full to see
is this more engaging and would I ever
use this in some video editing. Okay, so
you can see this is now rendered. So
let's open this up now. So you can see
it's stored here. Skills intro.mp4 here
and let's watch the full clip. Today we
are taking a look at versel skills.sh.
This is where you can kind of upgrade or
level up your agents like cloud code. So
let's take a look at it and see how we
can actually use this in practice. Yeah,
that was not maybe perfect. But I think
there are something here. So I'm
definitely going to explore this more.
How I can use Claude code with remotion
and the skills package to kind of edit
videos. Definitely going to explore it
more. So yeah, I think that was pretty
much it I wanted to cover today. So go
check it out. skills.sh. I think it's
pretty interesting and I think we're
going to see more of these agent
marketplaces popping up in 2026. So
yeah, thank you for tuning in. Have a
great day and I'll see you again.
