My goal for 2026 is to fully transition
into a builder with AI. Even for me
though, it's really hard to keep up with
all of the latest tools and
tactics that are popping up every single
day. We're in a really mellin
exploratory era with all this stuff.
Nobody really has definitive answers.
So, what are some of the right steps
that you can take to strengthen some of
these design engineering muscles?
Everybody's going to start having their
own workbench and that and that wall of
tools at the workbench is going to be a
little bit different for everyone.
What trends should designers jump on and
which ones can we safely ignore?
Claude code can be so many things that
aren't coding. Claude code is just
Claude's computer.
Welcome to Dive Club. My name is Vid and
this is where designers never stop
learning. This week's episode is
with Kyle Xantos, who's leading the new
UX tools labs, where he's responsible
for figuring out what matters when it
comes to new design tools and new
workflows. And as a result, he's pretty
quickly become one of my go-to resources
as I navigate my own journey building
with AI. So, this week's episode is a
deep dive into very specific tactics
that you can use on your own design
engineering journey. And to start, I
wanted to get his take on some
of the new cursor updates. You know,
last time I was on here, we were talking
about warp and using cloud code inside
of warp and stuff, and that is still a
great way to go, but cursor, they have
an inapp browser, which is cool. What
they added recently was this visual
editor, and this got a lot of people
talking. There was a big debate about it
that was spawned essentially from
cursor's positioning was like, "Hey,
look at all these tools. Aren't these
familiar to you as a Figma user? And
isn't it cool that we have these? There
shouldn't really be a divide essentially
between like design and engineering and
stuff." And so I started experimenting
with it. We didn't just get Figma buffer
code. That's still not still not
happening. But when you're doing tweaks
and stuff and want to just play with
like spacing or arrangements or
something like that, it's a pretty easy
win because this is an app that I
made for my friends and I. We've had a
long-standing NFL pickum pool. We used
to use Excel spreadsheets and then we
were using the Yahoo Fantasy app. This
year they were like, "Could you maybe
make one for us?" And I said, "Why don't
we try?" So, I did and we've
used it all season and it's great, but I
might want to tweak
like this has some extra padding that
seems unnecessary
and I might not know the exact value
that I want to change for that. So, it's
nice to just be able to do subtle tweaks
kind of go like,
yeah, that's a little better. Maybe I
could like bring it in a little bit.
Okay. Okay. you know, so I can do
little tweaks like that.
Like that's terrible.
That was terrible, but also really cool
to be able to do that in the UI.
Exactly. So, it's bad design
decision, but nice to just throw it in
there and see it immediately. Right. And
so, it's keeping you out of the
prompt loop that I think designers can
get stuck in or annoyed by, self
included. And it lets you play
and experiment quickly, right? And then
once you dial those in and you can go
as nerdy and as engineered deep as
you want in here, you know, with both
the design and the CSS and then you just
hit apply over here to have the
cursor agent. So I still don't even pay
for cursor right now. It just still
isn't my like desired AI. But from an
interface standpoint, I'm using cloud
code in a regular terminal in here in
cursor again. And I'm using the crap out
of the inapp browser and the visual
editor to just kind of imagine, tweak,
experiment, and get it in real time.
So I think it does matter to designers
from that. Let me do some tweaking
and some kind of experimentation, but
it's not, oh, this isn't the full like
Figma is dead and vectors are dead
totally moment, if there ever will be.
Is it enough though for
you to confidently say to a designer who
hasn't adopted any of these tools yet?
Hey, cursor probably is that first real
code editing tool working with
production cuz it's kind of at least for
me like I'm in warp right now. Like I
left cursor to use work with Claude code
and now I'm looking at this like man I
got some FOMO. I'm not going to lie.
Yeah, you probably should have FOMO
because it's pretty convenient. There
are other ways to do this kind of but as
an entryway cursor as an app like even
on the free plan. Yeah. You know what?
This is the other reason that I'd say it
is a good this is my tool for using
cloud code and and other CLI as a
designer starting out. This is the other
reason that I'd say that there is
something to be said. I still like
spinning up Cloud Code or Droid or
Codex or whatever in the CLI. I think
it works the best, but from a stuff can
be scary standpoint. The Cloud Code
extension, it's the VS Code extensions,
which again, Codex, Factory, and Cloud
Code all have. Those are all the CLI
based AI agents that I use for coding.
They have these interfaces essentially
via these extensions that might feel a
little bit more friendly to designers
that are getting started and you can do
all the same stuff and you just get it
in a layout that is a little bit more
friendly for folks that are still a
little bit scared of the terminal. Plus
the other thing is that you know if you
have a bunch of text and stuff in the
terminal you can only use your keyboard
to navigate but in here
I can do that. It's a big deal actually.
And amazingly, that's kind of a huge
deal. Even I still go back and forth
like it kind of feel like even
certain plugins or workflows still have
a few things that only work well or do
what it's supposed to do in the
true terminal CLI version as opposed to
the extension. But if you're starting
out, I think that it's perfectly fine to
use the extensions and give yourself a
more friendly UI for a designer to
get used to.
Okay. So, I want to keep tapping into
your perspective as somebody who is a
serial tinkerer and you're always like
playing with different workflows and
trying these tools and you're just
learning a lot that I think designers
can benefit from. So,
I kind of asked you to come to the table
with just some of these little
experiments and lessons and insights.
And really the goal, at least for me, is
to try to help designers who maybe feel
a little bit overwhelmed by the amount
of stuff going on, stay up to date with
what actually matters and come out of
this with some practical tactics that
they can immediately start incorporating
into their own workflows. So given that,
what are some of the things that you've
been adding to your own toolkit lately?
Yeah, and I got to be honest, too, like
I play around with tools. I tinker a
good amount, but I've figured out how to
limit myself better. And that's been
important because I really I'm skill
building right now. So much of my time
is spent trying to fill gaps that I have
in my knowledge to become closer and
closer to being able to call myself a
design engineer, you know, exploring
micro animations and things like that
and just learning code things in
general, right? So, like there's so many
tools and we're going to be in a tool
explosion right now. So, there's a lot
that you can ignore. The stuff that I
have today is more cuz I tried to not be
uber specific about this tool and this
tool and this tool and more like a
philosophy and approach in a way that if
you kind of are thinking this way, you
can just keep applying it to your set of
tools. Cuz I think everybody's going to
start having their own workbench and
that wall of tools at the
workbench is going to be a little bit
different for everyone and that's fine.
You can spend too much time getting too
like what exactly is the right setup.
One of those things is something that's
come up on your show a few times
recently from MDS a little bit
further back. Nick Patterson was
mentioning they're doing this and you're
starting to see this a lot more
around, but if you haven't started
doing this, I really recommend it, which
is make a playground for yourself
whenever you have something in your mind
that you want to execute in your design
and you can't find the existing version
of it. For my personal site that I'm
slowly but surely actually building. I
have this like, you know, this kind of
retrofuturistic
world that I've been building and like
AI imagery and video and stuff. It's
sort of a little nod of like this
alien material that's arrived that I'm
exploring.
And so I have this hover video,
right? And I wanted to put some music to
it. And I finally found like the I
found an old sample chop that I did that
I thought would work nicely with
it, but I couldn't find. So, you see how
I have like my sort of ghosted buttons
over here. I knew I wanted to put the
waveform like sound on, sound off thing
probably in the bottom right, but I
couldn't find an animated like version
of it that I liked. And so I just ended
up building a studio basically that gave
me a bunch of options to play around
with. So this I can actually try this.
That's so cool.
So then once I find my active state and
my muted state that feel good to me, I
can just grab this code and then bring
it in and tell Claude Code this is the
functionality that I want tied to my
waveform component and this is the
design and behavior that I want. And so
like this is something that once I
there's a few things I need to tweak,
but like I'll just go put this out
publicly and other people can play
around in here too and get their own
version and just paste that in,
right? Like I built in these different
effects. This is all, you know, trying
to fit with my sort of like imaginary
retrofuturistic world thing. But it's
just it's fun. It's useful. I've
already built all this out. So, you know
what I can do now is not make this
limited to just waveforms. I can keep
all these effects, right? Cuz I might
want to use more of these in other
places in my personal site while I'm
doing this sort of branding world
building thing. And I could just bring
in other icons or even honestly I could
make it accept images and stuff.
Yeah, you could do almost anything.
Yeah. Like another thing that I made
for the same reason was a hologram
projector that I can upload videos into
and displays in a cool interesting
3D way.
How are you coming up with some of the
language even for these different types
of prompts? Because I'm looking at these
effects. They're beautiful,
but I have no idea how to describe some
of these things. And so I can feel
myself wanting to recreate it and yet
I'm like, "Oh gosh, that blinking cursor
feels a little bit more intimidating
than normal when I'm trying to describe
things that I have no language for." So
how'd you even get to like this?
There's kind of two answers to
that in my mind. One is learn the
language of code and the sort of like
typical
developer nomenclature for it too. So
you can learn descriptor adjectives that
you see like other devs using to
describe certain things because the
likelihood that the LLMs were trained on
some of those words and stuff as the
translations for in natural language
we're calling this effect glitchy CRT
scan lines and it knows the code
translation of that. Right? So that's
one version of that answer. The other
version of that answer is something I've
started doing a lot more recently, which
is
just go if you find a source of
something you think is really cool, tell
Claude Code to go figure out how to do
it and then you can learn it as a skill
or just apply it to that app right away,
you know, whatever. So, case in point, I
saw a tweet from James McDonald
referencing this multi-layered shadow
technique and I clicked through it and I
just looked briefly at it and I was
like, "Oh my god, this speaks to me." It
is like subtlety that is obvious if you
know to look and it's sort of one of
those like before afters. Basically, the
idea is instead of literally applying a
border on your shape or your container
or something, instead put on a few
layers, in his case, he usually
references three different shadows
that are layered with different
opacities and spreads and values and
stuff. And they create a border effect,
but it's so much more subtle and it
feels so much more elevated figuratively
and literally. The aesthetic I just
I love. So, like I did it to a mobile
app that a set of games that I built for
my son who's a toddler and these are all
like games that help him learn
numbers and letters and sounds. He
like me actually I feel like he's
surpassed me in his NFL fandom. He's
obsessed. He can do all 32 of these no
problem. But just like look how nice
these borders are. And I just told
Claude Code while I was in
this repo, I dropped in this URL and
I said, "This technique is awesome. I
want it applied to our components. Go do
that." And it literally just went looked
at it, figured out the technique, ripped
the snippets, and then applied it to my
design. I even kind of started to
experiment like you can see I contained
the app in a phone like
container while you view it on desktop.
And so even there like these are three
layers to create that border effect. But
if you want a stronger border effect, I
was like, okay, take the same theory but
make it stronger. Maybe do like five
layers. And so that's how I got a
differentiation
in this phone container border effect
that feels different than this one. So
you can take the theory of hey some
layers of different values of shadows to
make a hybrid border/border
and elevation effect. But then you can
just keep again with the same philosophy
which Claude code is kind of like hip to
now that I fed at that URL. We could
keep extrapolating it and using it
differently in different places. Again,
for example, these buttons have, I
think, four layers instead of three. And
so, it's that slight differentiation.
I'm chuckling to myself because I did
the exact same thing with Derek Briggs's
tweet back from when he was working on
Campsite, and I know that him and James
have collaborated on that technique as
well. And so that's like definitely a
through line, but I took
a full tweet thread and an image and I
fed it to Claude Code while I was working
on the inflight UI kit and I was like,
don't copy this exactly, scan through
it
and figure out like where are the nice
easy wins based off of this tweet thread
cuz I want to steal some of the best
parts of this style. And it just worked.
And to this day, my buttons look so much
better in code than they do in Figma
because I haven't taken the time to go
through and do all the shadows and the
negative spreads. And I probably never
will.
Yeah, that's totally fair. I was so
excited by doing this and how well it
worked. I had done this before, but it
just really came through for me on
this and I started exploring Jakub's
articles more and realized again from
this sort of like we're talking about
theory right now, right? Like it's
literal but it's also philosophy and
approach and theoretical and stuff. And
one of the other people that I mean
since the beginning of me getting
starting to explore coding and designing
and code and stuff, Jhey Tompkins is you
know one of the top people that I've
been aware of. He's just so clever with
what he does, but he's so minimalistic
in the actual code. He's so surgical
with how he uses everything and
everything has a purpose and it's all so
slim. It's like such an
admirable philosophy, right? And so to
pull the thread further of essentially
referencing slash stealing but
referencing really great designers both
literal applications of techniques and
philosophy. I sent Claude Code on a
mission to create a new skill and agent
that embody the philosophies and the
techniques of Jakub and Jhey. So what I
did was I really like using the compound
engineering plugin for Claude Code that
is in the Every marketplace created by
Kieran Clawson. It's a really powerful
plugin. It can be overkill I think for
some folks but it's actually quite a bit
more approachable and easy to use than
you might think at first. But
regardless, it has a skill that
sets you up really well for creating
skills for yourself of your own. And
so I used that skill that it has and I
said, I love these guys. I pulled
together probably like 15 to 20 code
pens and some like tweets from Jhey. Scan
through all of Jakub's site. Scan
through these, you know, collection of
Jhey's code pens. Look through what's
happening in there, gather what's useful
from there from a literal sense and also
process this philosophically. I want a
skill that can do that well. So, how
should I do that? And basically what it
said was, we're going to make an agent
that uses a skill that has a bunch of
reference points. Basically I used them
to make a visual design interaction
design auditor that is invoked with this
skill basically and that launches the
custom Claude Code sub agent. So now
what I can do I think I actually did
this on the lunar lander game
recreation that we'll see later. I
had it where it was and then I sent the
agent go do an audit on all the visual
and interaction design of this app. This
is the literal skill.md but it has
these other pieces of the agent's
knowledge base that are helping guide it
through the audit.
Dude, this is so good. I'm really
underutilizing skills is what I'm
realizing just looking at this. Dude, I
got to tell you, like the skills thing,
I still kind of struggle with it. I
get it now mostly because of creating
this sub agent's skills. Are they that
different? I feel like I could do what
skills can do with sub agents. And so
honestly the easiest way for me to get
past that was to use the compound
engineering plugin's create a new skill
skill to build this out for me cuz I
wouldn't have known to go this
multi-layered.
Yeah. But I can tell you that having
used it, I understand now why layering
like this and having both the skill,
these other docs and the agent all
referencing each other and stuff
makes a lot of sense. But yeah, I send
this out. It gives me an audit and
recommendations of what I could change
to make it feel better from the
collective
philosophy that Claude Code kind of
amalgamated about what it observed from
Jhey and from Jakub's stuff that I sent
to learn about.
It's so good. I mean, I'm already
so glad that we're doing this episode
because this is incredibly practical for
me because I've been doing this
manually. For me, I look at those guys.
I look at Emil Kowalski's. I look at a
lot of stuff. So the amount of times
that I've fed tweet threads or articles
or snippets of his course into Claude
Code and then basically was just like
hey just read this and try to find
things that we can do better. I've done
that so manually at least 25 times and I
never thought of investing into a system
like this, but it makes so much sense
and such an easy way to elevate what I'm
able to bring to the table as somebody
who's a designer who's like tinkering in
code but definitely not a design
engineer yet.
That's what I loved about using the
compound engineering skill to make this
skill for me finally made me make sense
of all of it more. So again, heavily
recommend. All this stuff is free, which
is mind-blowing.
We'll put that in the show notes, too,
for someone who's listening cuz I also
haven't been there yet. So, I will be
clicking that link later as well.
He should have a whole episode about
compound engineering cuz it as a
philosophy is really powerful. I'm
trying to work it in more and more to my
stuff. What I really loved about it too
is that now that I have this agent and
this skill and this whole like folder, I
can add to it. So, I did this not as
like this is my end all be all of my
guys and this is it. It was just like I
know I really like these guys. Let's see
if we can do this and make it work. And
it does. So, now I can collect
more and just be like, hey, I want to
iterate on this skill and agent and this
whole situation. Here's a bunch more
links of stuff I like.
So, good.
Reassess and add it in and just like
and it's cool cuz you can kind
of make it think about it again. So you
already had these kind of these two
perspectives from Jakub and Jhey.
Let's add in Emil's with like 20 links
or something, right? As opposed to now
add Emil's perspective. You could almost
like think about everything together
now. So yes, we'll have Jhey's
perspective, Jakub's and Emil's, but now
think about like tell Claude Code to
zoom out yet again back to the source
material and think about what the
general philosophy becomes with the
three layers of perspective instead of
the two. And so instead of just adding
one layer to the cake, you're changing
the whole construction of the cake when
you add this other ingredient into or
you can if you want to. And in my mind,
that's where I want to go cuz then it's
refining more and more this amalgamation
of techniques and philosophies and stuff
that I find really compelling.
I find it really
encouraging. Again, as someone who I
kind of want to be more
of a design engineer, you know, all day
today, I have not really made that much
in Figma. I've mostly been in Claude Code
because I'm iterating on something that
I already designed in Figma and had
built with an engineer. So, yeah, I want
to grow that muscle, right?
Like I want to be more of a design
engineer. I had no interest in really
getting into the intricacies of syntax.
I do think I have decent taste, you
know, and honestly, I think you kind of
do, too. Like, we're obviously looking
at the same types of people for
inspiration. Those are who I would
consider the best of the best for sure.
This creates that very clear tangible
mechanic that I can use to act on my
taste, right? It's like
I know this is good and now I can
actually use it instead of just pointing
at it and saying that it's good. What a
fun set of next steps. I'm really
excited about this.
The amount of just amazing lessons
and knowledge out there for free is
staggering. So finding ways to actually
leverage that. It's that like AI doing
that 10x thing that you have to start
thinking that way to get the full 10x
out of the potential of the 10x.
Otherwise you could end up at like two
still which is great still but you got
to start thinking in that systematizing
collecting. Now, you can get big bloat,
too, and end up like with nothing
usable. Also, like don't create
one skill that is every designer you've
ever thought was cool, you know? Like,
don't do that cuz that'll be useless.
Like, you do want to be somewhat
surgical and intentional and stuff. And
as I go along, like when I use this
skill and stuff more, it can be overly
conservative on how obvious the effect
should be because it has that subtlety
influence from processing Jhey and Jakub
stuff. But like I don't always want
everything to be super subtle. Sometimes
you want it to be like big but done in a
reasonable tasteful way, right? So I
might say at some point take it out of
our general philosophy that like
everything needs to be subtle. Change it
more to is this the type of animation
that might be something you want the
user to kind of grab onto or is this a
little tasty a little background for the
if you know you know crowd that should
take that really subtle approach to
it. Right? And so you can just keep
iterating, create the thing, and then
over time give it your feedback of your
taste of what to do with the taste it
sort of ingested from these reference
points.
Let's keep the train moving here. What
are some of the other
things that you think more designers can
have in their toolkit for 2026? Yeah.
So, aside from making your own like full
tool studio thing that has the
parameters and stuff, and I know you
were saying you just were doing this
yesterday, and I had seen this before,
but it was a conversation I had with
Will King. Shout out Will. He just was
like, "Dude, this is such an easy win."
Cuz honestly, what I was talking to him
about was how do I become more of a
design engineer than just a designer
that's learning some code? And one of
the things he said is like, "Dude, this
easy win is bring in this control
panel." The one that I'm using is called
Leva. That's L-E-V-A. Another popular one, I
think, is Tweakpane, but Leva
seems to just work really well with
Next.js and React and all those things.
And you can just tell Claude Code, I
want you to incorporate a Leva control
panel. And literally every parameter on
here is up to you. It needs to go set it
up for you and assign variables and
things like that,
but it gives you the, you know, again,
what designers feel like they can be
missing when they're designing in code
is nailing those details, especially in
like interaction design and stuff. So,
this is also for my personal site. This
is going to be like a throwaway is kind
of the wrong word, but kind of. I'm
just going to house this in this little
retrofuturistic tablet thing that I've
made. It's a game. I recreated the lunar
lander game. It was my dad's favorite
game way back in the day. And when we
were young, like killing time in the car
or something, my dad was an early
adopter, so he was a Palm Pilot person.
And they had the lunar lander game and we
would totally just sink 45 minutes into
that with the stylus and everything.
So, I went and was like, "Oh, this fits
thematically and it's kind of a nod to
my dad and my past and stuff." And I'm
just making this as a little bonus
Easter egg in my personal site, but it's
fully functional. Like, all of this is
real. So, I've got the rocket here and
I've got the lander. Eventually,
zantos.co
will have the fruition of all this.
You've seen some of the other images.
I've shown you some of the visual
language that I've been creating
around this imaginary world that now I
also have to incorporate my son into
because he saw me working with it for
mine. He's three and a half and he was
like can I see myself in space too and I
was like
yeah give me a little bit. I've
basically become a creative studio for
my toddler. That's straight up what's
happening now.
Truly though truly it is building
for yourself and the people immediately
in your orbit
is how I've learned almost everything
about coding and building and doing all
that stuff. So, if you notice here, I've
got these corners sitting on all of the
cards, and the hover state draws them
from the corner
to the middle. So, they start from each
corner, and they animate to meet in the
middle.
Now, I might want that to be
a little bit snappier.
So, I made the transition shorter
or a little bit more luxurious. And
there's that last like it kind of
joins the initial line and then there's
a following that's like the edge tracer
that comes after it. So, the triggering
of when that secondary tracer comes in,
I can tweak here.
What does it take to spin up Leva like
this? Cuz I actually haven't used this.
Anytime I need a control, I
actually just custom build it. But
this is way better than anything I coded
quickly.
No, seriously, like nothing. Like just
tell Claude Code I want to use Leva.
This is the stuff I want to be able to
control. Make a plan. Like it's
Man, I've been doing this all wrong.
That's why we do this. And again, yeah,
shout out Will for reminding
me of this. Like I just I'd seen some
folks do it before, but reminding me of
just the incredible power of it with
total simplicity for your coding agents
to set up for you. And you can tell it
in your human terms. Like I even,
described in natural language how
I wanted these corners to exist and draw
themselves to each other on hover. That
was all natural language. So, even when
it came to getting the controls around
it, I still it's just like I wanted to
be able to tweak stuff around that
effect
like that. It's not even
that much more detailed
than that. You could just say all the
things around the hover states for the
cards in the level selector. And
that's what I did yesterday. I had a
pulsing animation for an idle state
cuz I was trying to communicate that you
can slide something
and I just knew I needed some
movement but I had no idea like should I
use react motion? What kind of easing
curve or spring? Like I just didn't even
know. So I kind of just had it throw
something and then my prompt was and
give me knobs for all of the relevant
controls that I might want. Like I
didn't even know what they
would be
and it worked. It worked. It wasn't as
good as this. I should totally use Leva
next time, but it's not.
But it's still that simple, too.
It's basically what you did, but to make
it a little better, you just need to
know, oh, yeah, the Leva control panel,
which is awesome. And this is again
where it's just like collect those
knowledge chunks as you're on Twitter
and as you're on the web and like be
careful of amassing too much that you'll
never use, but stuff that you find
that's like, oh my god, that's a
no-brainer. Another thing that you could
do specifically for Claude Code, you can
go into your global user settings. So I
could open up a Claude Code session be
like, hey, put in my global claude.md
essentially. So that's known to Claude
Code in any project or session you do.
Whenever I say give me controls to tweak
something about UI, when I say that, you
should know to go grab the Leva
component, bring it into our app and ask
me any clarifying questions you have
about exactly what things even from a
natural language perspective I want to
be able to tweak within the control
panel so it sets up the right
parameters. Okay, let's dig into that
for a second because this is another
area that I know that I'm
underutilizing. So, are there other easy
wins or no-brainers that you think
designers should do to invest in that
top level claude.md file?
Globally, be slim. Only put stuff in
your global one that is like truly
universal to what you use Claude Code for
in general too. Even at your project
level, claude.md, it's tempting to use
it as your tome, like your journal of
everything that you do to your app and
how everything works and all that. That
becomes inefficient because claude.md and
agents.md if you're using Factory,
Droid, or Codex, they are persistent
memory.
So, there's plenty of stuff that Claude
Code doesn't need to know all of the
time, even if it's critical about your
app. Like, if I'm messing with UI stuff
in my NFL pickum app, I don't
really need it to know everything about
what the API is doing while I'm working
on something on the front end. And
having that in there bloats its
context, making its memory worse. So in
general what I found is be slimmer on
your claude.mds both global and local
project level and even further you can
make claude.md files in individual
subdirectories that just pertain to your
documentation or your backend stuff or
your components and stuff. So being a
bit more surgical about that is really
helpful for I know I want to work around
the components and make our tokens
and our design system more robust and
stuff and then you can have that claude.md
for just that but then it's not
staying in its persistent memory for
like if you're working at the top level
and working on the whole app in general.
The reason this is a hard one to answer
definitively is because go look on
Twitter, YouTube, Google, whatever. And
the philosophies around this stuff is a
huge spectrum, right? And I've spent so
much time previously
reading and following everyone's advice
of set up your things this way, do your
flow exactly this way, use this new MCP
that does this and this and you can
learn from that. And I'm not poo
pooing that entirely, but what I did
find was it's easy to get caught up cuz
that stuff changes so fast. Like the
recommendations from 4 months ago almost
certainly are not ones you should follow
today if it was made literally 4 months
ago unless it's a philosophical thing.
And that's where I'm like, learn the
philosophy and the approach and the
ethos of all of this more than the
literal way to direct your AI to be
better because they level up themselves
so often. I can't tell you how many
times I've built little tools for myself
in the past more in my earlier days
like Claude Code itself just like sent
out as an update like two months later
that I sunk 20 hours into
making this little tool and just like
yeah that's not necessary and keep in
mind that all of these people they're
content creators they get views from 10x
your Claude Code production by doing
these three things right they're not the
authority on all this there's still
plenty to learn I'm not again I'm not
out on all of this entirely, but I think
you're better off understanding the
philosophy and the theory of most of
this, figuring out how to implement it.
Sometimes experimenting, you know,
again, that compound engineering plugin
is one of those things that I'd say
that's one of them that's like, no, do
try that. But you also just download
the plugin and kind of learn how to do
the slash plan workflow slash review, but
it's not a whole big setup that you see
that has 10 steps on a YouTube video or
something. It's kind of a vague answer
for like what to put in there and what
not to.
I respect the answer a lot actually and
you've made it
because there's no great answer to do
that.
Yeah, that's and the reality
is we're filming this video. It's going
to be very helpful. And even though
you're making a point of staying at a
philosophical level, certain things are
going to be outdated. You know,
this is not evergreen content.
Yeah. It's just they keep leapfrogging
each other. And so especially as
designers who are not as technical and
at least for myself if I get a piece of
advice I kind of follow it to the letter
because I don't have the first
principles knowledge to deviate as well
or to know what little bits and pieces
to take. And so keeping that more
level-headed approach
I think is a good it's something that
I'm glad to have in this video. I guess
anybody who's watching or listening or
whatever like you know plays guitar or
something like how many pedals and amps
and guitars and pickups and everything
are there that like there is no answer
to what's the best setup, right? Like
we're basically in that territory with
AI tools. Same way with guitars. Like
you're always going to get a better
sound out of a tube amp if you don't
specifically want the solid state sound
that you know metal players want and
things like that. So there's basic
tenets like that. Plan before you
execute with your agents. That's like
finally all the tools have built that in
as more of the standard, but that's
been true for a while and it
just keeps being true. But aside from
that, when it's all these different
setups and stuff, like play around.
You're going to keep evolving. You're
going to keep learning. You're going to
keep figuring out what works
for you. And then talk to people, read,
learn, absorb new philosophies, try that
philosophy out, see how it works for
you. We're in a really exploratory era
with all this stuff.
Nobody really has definitive answers
outside of some of those big core
tenets of this is the best way to do
this, this, and this. Feel it out. Find
what you like, too. Make sure that
you're following and looking at people
doing that kind of thing. And then go
play around and follow your passion
there. You'll learn a lot quicker
that way and become less susceptible to
the loop of optimize, optimize,
optimize, optimize and spending more
time on like your system and your
setup than doing the actual thing. The
importance of experimentation comes up a
lot. I totally agree. That's like the
era that we're in. The reality is like
not everybody has this blank credit card
that is the corporate card
that they get to just point at anything.
And so there is some strategy especially
as someone who's like charting a
learning path for themselves this year
but they don't have unlimited funds.
Like how do you think about the right
way to invest in these tools in a way
that makes sense for like an individual
who just wants to grow who doesn't have
this unlimited budget?
Free trials are awesome. Use them. At
the UX Tools Lab stuff. We're going to
be trying to put out ways for you to
really condense like, should I care
about this? Do I need to pay attention
to this? Cuz there's way too many and
there's so much noise and there's going
to be plenty of overlap and stuff. So,
you know, we're talking about setting up
all your tools and your workbench and
all that kind of thing. And figuring out
combos for those can be really good in
stretching your dollars. So, let's
say, you know, someone asked me a
question about I hit my Claude Code
limits on my $20 plan quickly,
regularly, and then it kind of breaks my
flow cuz I'm like exploring. I'm doing
stuff and stuff's working. It's like,
you've hit your limit now, and you won't
be a limit will reset at 2 p.m. and it's
like 11:00 a.m. And it's just like it's
such a frustrating wall to hit. So, like
one thing that I like to do is combine a
Claude Code subscription and I have a
Factory Droid $20 subscription. And
Factory is nice because it's like Cursor
in that most of the major LLMs that
you'd want to be using for coding
are available in there. Gemini 3 Pro is
great for UI generation. I'll go
do stuff with Gemini 3 Pro through
Factory to go execute that stuff, then
hop over to Claude Code, the regular
Claude Code to be doing bigger things,
even though Claude Code also exists in
Factory. But either way, I could bounce
one direction or the other if I'm
running out of my tokens in Factory or
if I've hit my limit in Claude Code. You
can add Factory or add Cursor. Add
that $20 of one of those and then
theoretically you could be doing a fair
amount for $40. What I would say is if
you're spending a decent amount of time
in Claude Code that $100 tier is I use
it. That's what I have. I almost never
hit the limits and I hit it pretty
hard a lot of the time. So, it feels
like a lot, but you just got to like
zoom out a little bit and think about
what you're doing with Claude Code.
Because keep in mind, like I'm not just
building with Claude Code. Like I sent
you, the Obsidian doc of some
of the things that we're thinking about
talking about today. And that's this. I
have my Claude Code sitting on top of my
Obsidian vault. And it helps me
structure all this stuff. I can interact
with Linear just through Claude Code to
Linear and just kind of like clean
out these issues and let's optimize
these and if these are in this kind of
state put it on hold and blah blah blah.
So like Claude Code can be so many
things that aren't coding. Claude Code
is just Claude's computer. That's
another one of those categories where
I'm like, I know there's something there
for me and it just kind of keeps getting
knocked down the totem pole a little
bit, but I see some of these workflows
that people are stringing together using
Claude Code way outside of like the
context of an IDE that are really
compelling.
That actually gives me a good reminder
of a thought that I had in that
experimentation realm. If you can block
out at least a half day, if it needs to
be on a weekend, fine. If it's during
the week and you can do that with your
schedule, great. I've started to do what
I'm calling tuneup days. And it's
specifically for I'm not allowed to
actually be productive in like a
project. I can only enhance my setup.
Finally bring in that workflow that
people have been talking about. Finally
install that plugin and try out the
compound engineering and finally
clean up my folder structures of this
and that like a lot of those finally
things. I have content sections of
it. So education stuff. If there was an
interview I'd really been wanting to
thoughtfully consume for a while, I'll
do that on a tuneup day or an article
that I want to be thoughtful about.
Playgroundy stuff too, like go do
something that has no like stuff for my
toddler. I just experiment with
stuff all the time. Like right now, I'm
adding to his games app basically an app
within that for drawing on the iPad,
both for coloring and tracing
letters to learn how to write his
letters. That's a playgroundy kind of
thing. And giving yourself the time
to play is a really good way to give
yourself the license to go grab that
tool, go sign up for that trial, give it
a shot. I've been hearing about this
thing a million times. Let's actually
figure out what that does and does this
matter for me and stuff. So, when it
comes to the experimentation stuff and
the overwhelm of all of that, I keep a
running list of things that I'll want to
do for my next tuneup day. And then when
it gets to that day, I'll sort of like,
all right, I'll pick out this one and
this and this and this and then I go do
those. Well, I feel like this entire
episode has been a tuneup day for me and
thank you for having me. I
have a handful of very practical
next steps. It's corny to say, but I
literally
wrote out on my own intentions for this
year. Like I want to be more of a design
engineer.
Yes.
This just got me excited, you know, like
this got me energized and gave me some
very practical next steps that I can
take. So, I appreciate you as always,
Kyle, for coming on. It's been fun.
For sure. Thanks for having me, man.
