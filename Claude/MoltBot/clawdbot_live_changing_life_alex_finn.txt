Today I'm going to be taking you through
Claudebot, the most powerful AI tool I
believe that's ever been made. I'll show
you what I'm doing with it. I'll show
you how to get more out of it and I'll
show you how to leverage this incredible
technology. We're going to have a ton of
fun today. Welcome to the live stream.
This will all be live live. We'll be
going through Claudebot. Feel free to
ask any questions you have in the chat.
Any questions you have at all in the
chat, put them there. I'll be going
through the chat throughout the entire
stream. We have so much to go through
today. I'm going to pull open my Clawbot
right now so we can just get straight
into this. We're gonna get straight into
this. I have so much to go through, so
much to show you. I'm going to I want to
show you kind of the first latest update
I've uh I implemented. I hope everyone's
doing well. I hope everyone's having a
good time here. Let's do this. Let's
share the screen. Let's just get
straight into it. Let's get straight
into it. Let's pray to God. I'm not
about to share anything that is
compromising in any sort of way. Let's
make sure here. Let's see here. Let's
see here.
Okay, perfect.
I'll share my screen. I'm not sharing
anything compromising. Let's go. I hope
everyone has had an amazing week. It has
been a whirlwind week since Claudebot
launched for me. Uh, it is what I
believe to be the most powerful AI tool
I've ever used in my entire life. I've
I've implemented some incredible use
cases. I have so many use cases and
workflows. I haven't shown anyone yet.
We'll be going through a few of that a
few of those on this stream. I have
another video coming later today that
goes through another five unbelievable
workflows uh I've never shown anyone
before. The capabilities of this tool
are unbelievable. They're unlimited.
They're unlimited. Unlimited, as Russell
Wilson would once say, right? You can
extend this, customize this any way you
want, which is unbelievable. I'm going
to show you some of those ways you can
customize it and extend it. today as
ideas come down to me, I'm actually
going to feed them to my Claudebot
Henry. Uh, so I can remember that. Talk
about how to make it way more proactive.
Brain dumping. Okay, I'm getting some
ideas as I flow here. That's how that's
how this brain works. How's everyone
doing? We're about to get I'm about to
show you some amazing things. I'm about
to show you some amazing things my
Clawude bot does for me. This is a live
stream. I don't know if people realize
sometimes I feel like people don't
realize this when they're watching this.
This is a live stream. I am live right
now. I'm going to show you things live.
This is not going to be as tight and as
quick as a tightly edited YouTube video,
which is probably how you discovered me
over the last few days. If you want
tightly edited in five minute video,
then just check out the main channel.
This is going to be a 2hour live stream
where we're going to do a whole bunch of
things live. I'm going to discover new
workflows live. I'm going to show you
workflows live. I'm gonna answer your
questions in the chat live. Moltbot,
this is my number one obje objection
getting I keep calling it Claudebot.
People keep going Molbbot. Moltbot,
Maltbot. Uh, yes, I'm aware it's
Moltbot. Yes, I'm aware that is the
latest name for this tool. No, I'm not
going to call it Moltbot, at least for
another month. It is what it is. Deal
with it. Everyone still has Claudebot on
their brain. Everyone still has
Claudebot in their brain until people's
mental SEO changes to Moltbot. I'm gonna
call it Clawbot. And then once the
energy has shifted and people's ideas
default is now Maltbot, I'll start
calling it Molbbot. But I think people's
default brain still says Claudebot. So
I'm going to keep calling it Claudebot
in the meantime. So I will keep saying
Claudebot this entire time. No maltbot
yet. Please talk about OOTH method.
Please. Uh so I'm hearing from people
that
let me make sure. Let's see what's going
on here. I have nothing nothing revealed
here, right? Uh, okay. Perfect. Nothing
crazy being shown here. Yeah. Okay,
good. Uh, I
am reading that people are getting We
got some risky things we're showing off
today on our computer live, by the way.
I might expose every key on the planet
and lose my entire computer. But we'll
see. Who knows? Who knows what will
happen? That's the drama. Who knows what
keys and API keys I'll expose on live
stream today. Uh, please talk about OOTH
method, please.
I'm hearing from some people that using
the Claude Oath is kicking them is
getting them kicked off the Claw plan.
Here's what it comes down to. Here is
what it comes down to. Claude Opus is
the greatest AI model of all time.
Period. End of story. It is the best way
to run Claudebot. It is what it is.
I'll just say this. If you use the API
keys, you are going to be spending
significantly more than $200 a month.
Significantly more than $200 a month if
you use this tool with any sort of
regularity. So if you use the OOTH,
there is risk.
There is risk. You might get kicked off.
Is it the worst thing in the world if
you get kicked off? I don't know. Maybe
just put in another credit card number
and get a different subscription. or if
they're really going to play hard ball
like that and stop you from using their
service on every credit card and address
and phone number you got, then screw
them. Who cares? Uh, but in the moment,
Opus is the best. And I think using Opus
on Claudebot is life-changing.
I really do believe that. I I think it's
unbelievable. I think from a personality
perspective, it's the best. I think from
a a uh intelligence perspective, it's
the best. Now, I will say this.
According to benchmarks and according to
what I'm hearing, Kimmy K2.5
is just about as good as Opus is just
about as good. I need to test this. I
will test this. I will be spinning up a
new computer with a new instance of
Claudebot with Kimmy K2.5 attached to
see how the workflows vary, to see if
it's better. I will be doing that. I
will be reporting back to you for the
latest on which models are the best,
which models you should be using for
Claudebot. Make sure to subscribe and
turn on notifications down below. Very
critical. Also very critical because
about an hour and a half to two hours
after this video live stream ends, I
will be releasing a new YouTube video
about five use cases to implement with
Claudebot today that will change your
life forever. that's coming out about an
hour and a half after this live stream
ends. Make sure to turn on notifications
for that. When I drop that video, pop it
open, leave a like, watch it to the end.
That's the best way to support the
channel.
They just revoked my token I use for
Claude, but I still have my plan and
still use Claude Coke. Yeah, here's a
couple things.
My guess is the people saying, "Oh, I
got banned from Claude uh because I used
it." are just rage baiting. They're just
click baiting. I don't that makes no
sense that Anthropic would turn off
people's subscriptions and stop say,
"Hey, stop giving us $200 a month
because you're doing this." That's
they're not going to go after the drug
users. They're going to go after the
drug sellers. You know what I'm saying?
Do you know what I mean by that? They're
going to go after Claudebot. So,
basically what they're do is they're
going to cut Claudebot off from using
the OOTH. I don't think they're going to
ban you for using the Claude Oath. So, I
don't want to give you professional
recommendations, but
use the oath. Use the cloud off. If they
ban you, then whatever. If they're not
going to ban you. If they cut you off,
then whatever. Then you start using the
API. It's against terms of service. It's
against terms of service. Your face is
against terms of service. I don't care.
Who cares? This is a doggy dog world,
baby.
Super intelligence is on the line. We're
six months away from the permanent
underclass. Just use whatever the best
model is. Do you want to escape the
permanent underclass or not? Don't talk
to me about terms of service. I care
more about the leaving the permanent
underclass than the terms of service.
Jesus.
Let me make sure I make this so doesn't
call off the chat. It's not made for
kids. Uh doggy dog world. Yeah. Only
watch this live stream if you're
prepared to fight in a doggy dog world.
Use the claw oath. Who cares? There. I
said it. I I didn't I didn't think I was
going to say it, but I just said it. Who
cares? Jesus.
>> [sighs]
>> Just you. Who cares? If you get kicked
off, then use something else. I've
tested this with basically every model
except Kimmy K2.5.
There's nothing close to Opus. There's
nothing close.
Here's another prediction.
Here's another prediction for you. I
think we are 12 months away at the most
from there being a bum rush for powerful
hardware.
We got a lot to get in today. If this is
your first time watching the stream,
which I imagine it might be because
there's like 300 people in here and
there's usually like 120. Uh we're going
to demo, we're going to go through
things. I'm also going to rant and tell
and give you tips and tricks and tell
you important things. I'll give you
predictions about the future. This is
one of the predictions about the future.
Ask questions in the chat. I'll get to
the chat. I'm going to get to the chat.
I'm going to go through everything. I
think we are at most 12 months away from
an absolute stone- cold bum rush for
hardware. I think we're already in the
middle of it for power users. I think
right now power users are going out and
and buying as much hardware as they can.
The cost of uh RTX5090s doubled from
2,000 to $4,000 over the last week. We
are at most 12 months away from an
absolute stone cold bum rush for
hardware from normies. Right now it's
the power users doing it. We're at most
12 months away from normies doing it.
Why? Why is that? A couple reasons. I
truly believe Claudebot is about to blow
up. I don't I do not think this is a
trend. I do not think Claudebot is a
trend. I think this is going to be
something that will be placed on so many
people's computers that will be using
it. That's number one. Number two, I
think because of that, a lot of these
companies will be cutting off OOTH from
it because Claudebot uses so many
tokens. I believe that
a lot of these AI companies will cut off
OOTH from Clawbot. You're already
starting to see it with Claude, right?
So boom, they start cutting off OOTH.
What does that leave you with? That
leaves you with the APIs. The using APIs
with Cloudbot is going to be extreme.
It's going to be expensive. It is going
to get very expensive. It is going to
get very expensive. At the same time as
all of that, local models will get
significantly better and require less
hardware. You see it already. Kimmy K2.5
is basically Opus level and can be run
locally on two Mac Studios.
You can run Opus locally today for under
$30,000.
And that might sound like a lot of money
to you, but that is mind-blowing. A year
ago, running an Opus type model on
hardware would cost you half a million
dollars. In one year, it's gone down
from half a million to 30,000. So, my
prediction
that I'm giving you right now, and you
can do with this information however you
want. I think we are at most 12 months
away from an absolute bumrush of
hardware
for the normie user that's going to want
to go out once their OOTH is cut off on
all their really powerful uh tools like
Clawbot. They're going to go out,
they're going to try to buy hardware so
they can run their models locally so
they can get unlimited usage
for their tools like Clawbot.
So what is so what's my recommendation
based on that information to you?
Strongly consider if you can afford it
if you can afford it strongly consider
buying hardware that runs local models.
Even if the models aren't that great
it's important I think at this moment to
start to get into it to get ahead of
that trend before it happens. I a few
days ago bought
a Mac Studio with 512 gigabytes of
memory.
It cost me I have a friend who works for
Apple, so I got a discount. Uh I got a
15% discount or something. It cost me
$8,400,
but I will be able to run a lot of
really good models on that hardware and
I will be able to if I get kicked off
Claude Opus
be able to power Claudebot with those
local models. Will it be as good as
using Claude Opus? No.
But if I were to use the Claude Opus
API, I'd be spending like $4,000 a month
on it.
Right? And so I think we're going to
start seeing that more and more and
more. And so I'm just telling you when
the bum rush happens,
hardware is going to be a bottleneck.
It's going to be a bottleneck. And the
more people buying the same supply of
hardware, the more expensive the
hardware gets, right? So if they put out
a Mac studio, it costs $5,000. They make
a h 100,000 of them and 20 million
people try to buy those Mac Studios.
What do you think happens to the price
of those Mac Studios?
Everything gets more expensive. I think
the Mac Studio M5 that's going to come
out in June prediction is going to be
slightly more expensive than the Mac
Studios from last year.
I think the Mac Studio M6 that comes out
next year, 2027, is going to be double
the price of all Mac Studios from this
year. I think this year is a slight step
up in price. I think next year is a
massive step up. I think it gets
exponential and that stuff doubles. So
again, I don't want to tell you how to
spend your hard hard uh earned money.
Although right now I'm going to tell you
how to spend your hard-earned money if
you can afford it. If you care about AI
and technology, if you know you want to
implement workflows that make your life
better with AI, I recommend buying
hardware
before the bum rush happens. If you
think Mac minis in 2027 are going to
cost $600, you are insane.
There is a zero. Do a test with Kimmy,
dude. I'll do a test with Kimmy in a
second. We'll do a test with Kimmy. I
just want to get the important stuff out
of the way. Let's get the important
stuff out of the way. Then I'll test
Kimmy out.
Right now, I got my Mac Mini for $600. I
could have got off Amazon for 500. I
wanted to go to the Apple store
immediately and buy a Mac Mini, so I I
paid 600. Whatever.
Mac minis are not going to be $600 in
2027. The my prediction is the M6 Mac
Mini will cost at minimum $1,000. It
will go from $500 to a,000. I don't want
to say guaranteed, but guaranteed
guaranteed. The bum, it's already
happening. I think this was the first
domino. I think this was the first
domino of
the hardware bum rush. Claudebot coming
out and everyone rushing to buy a Mac
Mini is domino number one of the
hardware bumrush. It's going to then
turn into Mac Studios once people, you
know, now they're open- source pill.
Right now maybe they want to run Kimmy
K2.5 locally. Now Mac Studios are flying
off the shelf. Now your entry level Mac
Studios $10,000. Right? That's my
prediction on what happened. So starting
off a little prediction. I put my order
in four days ago for a Mac Studio M3
Ultra with 512 gigabyte.
I put my order in. It cost me $8,500,
$10,000 before discount. I think that
setup cost easily $20,000
a year and a half from now. Easily.
Easily. So, if you are remotely
interested in being an AI power user, I
recommend getting your hardware. Which
takes us to the next question before we
get into uh me playing around with
Claudebot and showing you a whole bunch
of cool things. I have a lot of cool
things lined up for you here with
Claudebot and with some things I built
with Claudebot. I'm going to show you
how to build some really really cool
things. I'm going to answer this
question. I'm going to look at a few
other chats. If you have any questions
at all, get in the chat. I read all the
chats. Uh unless you say something mean,
then I don't read it because I don't see
it because all I see is positivity, no
negativity. Right. Number we have
there's when you're trying to escape the
permanent underclass, there's no room
for negativity. I ignore all negativity
when you're trying to escape the
permanent underclass.
RVP dead.
I'll say this.
When Claudebot came out, what about the
Nvidia? I I'll cover Nvidia DJX Spark in
a second. Let me just answer this
question because I think this is an
important question and I'm covering this
at length on my Twitter today. So follow
the Twitter if you haven't already. Can
you run Claudebot on Windows? Yes, you
can.
So, you have two options basically for
running Claudebot, right? VPS
and
a local device. VPS, virtual private
server, right? A server on the internet
or what most people are doing, buy a Mac
Mini. But I'm going to say Mac Mini, but
you can replace the word Mac Mini with
any local device. So, if you have an old
2020 laptop, you know, anything, a
Raspberry Pi, a Windows computer, you
can replace Mac Mini with that. I'm
going to say Mac Mini because that's
just what I'm going to do.
VPS versus Mac Mini. I strongly
recommend Mac Mini. Again, you can
replace that with laptop, computer,
Raspberry Pi, any local device, Xbox
360, whatever you want, right?
I strongly recommend Mac Mini. Here's
the reasoning.
If you are a non-technical user or non
I'm going to actually not even non
technical if you're a nons super
technical user
by default
your VPS that you sign up for is not
secure by default. To make a VPS secure
you have to do a bunch of technical
work, right? You have to set up
security. you have to do this, that,
protocols, things like that, right?
Download keys. By default, your VPS is
not secure.
If you're a non-technical user and you
buy a Mac Mini, by default, your Clawbot
is secure by default. Your Claudebot
becomes insecure once you connect it to
your email and have it search the web
and it can get prompt injected, right?
To make your Mac Mini not secure, you
have to do stuff. to make your VPS not
secure, you do nothing. It's by default
not secure. And that's why I recommend
for most people, especially the
non-technical users, you should get a
Mac Mini.
And even on top of that, just take
security out of the equation.
But take security out of the equation. I
still think it's better to get a Mac
Mini because as I said at the beginning
of this stream, I think it is really
important
to consider open source. I think it's
really important to start investigating
owning your own hardware. I think
getting your own hardware will be near
impossible for the normal average person
for the next 20 years. I think uh AI
models will only become more restrictive
by the companies, right? You're seeing
people getting kicked off the OOTH now
for using this. I think they'll only
tighten down, clamp down more. You're
seeing rumors about Open AI stealing
ideas. If you start a business idea on
Open AI, they take a cut or something
like that. I think they'll only start
getting more restrictive. I think
they'll only start taking away more. And
so, I think you're going to really want
to get your own hardware running your
own local models because that is
freedom. That is freedom, baby. America,
baby. Freedom.
So I recommend even even if you take
security out of it, I think having your
own hardware, tinkering on your own
device, experimenting on your own
device, doing cool things on your own
devices is one important and two just
fun. It's just fun. It's just fun. I got
a Mac Mini sitting on my desk right now.
There's a freaking AI agent running
around all over the wazoo doing things
for me left and right, building things,
creating things, writing things,
researching things. That's sick. That's
fun, baby. That's fun.
You're allowed to do things just for the
fun of it.
Hey, I'm new. I want to see you crush
it. Let's effing go, says Robin Ekran.
Do Do you not think I'm crushing it
right now? Robin Ekran, if you don't
think I'm crushing it right now, then
get out of here. You're kicked out of
the club. I'm crushing it. If you don't
think I'm crushing it, I don't want you
here.
By the way, I'm about to crush it inside
of uh Clawbot. Let's just see a few more
of these me. I think this is helpful. I
have 20 plus computers, says Chris. Ni9
SD. That's sick, man. Good for you.
That's a lot of computers. 20 computers.
That's a lot of computers for one person
to have. Have Cloudbot configure a
firewall and IPS for VPS. For sure,
100%. You can have CL, if you're doing a
VPS,
you can 100% go to your Cloudbot and
have it do that.
I just think for non-technical people
having them do that. It's just like buy
a Mac Mini, you know? It's like do you
really like you that just that's just
for non-technical users that's a lot of
work and to make sure to get it right
and to maintain that that's a lot of
work. And I think for the average person
that's insecure, right? You're seeing a
lot of these posts on X about people are
doing scans online for insecure virtual
private servers and they're just able to
hack it and take all your keys just like
that.
Hey, I found you recently and really
resonated with the oneman business you
are running as I am in the same boat.
I'm in the hiring process but feels like
Claudebot is better and cheaper than
salary 100%. And that's why I'm nervous.
That's why I'm nervous. Uh that's why
I'm I'm very nervous is because I do
believe Claudebot's going to replace
jobs once this gets into the the
corporate world. I do believe this will
this will lead to the loss of jobs. I'm
also very excited because as a oneperson
business, as a soloreneur, this is the
best thing that ever happened to me. I
have employees working for me 247. It
cost me the cost of a Mac Mini and the
cost of a Cloud subscription. This is
incredible.
Claude said, "My MacBook Air didn't have
enough RAM or memory to run a task."
What task? What are you doing, dude?
Dude, you make me want to order another
Mac Mini every time I see one of your
videos. Lol. Well, do you already have a
Mac Mini, Aaron? Do you need more Mac
Minis? That's I mean, listen, I don't
think there's anything wrong with
running out and getting hardware. I do
not. There's people on X um consumerism
is taking over the world. Why do people
think they need to buy Mac minis for
this? You don't need Mac Mini. Just get
a VPS, which is the most technical thing
you'll ever set up, which everyone will
immediately hack and you'll lose all
your information and data and your life
will be ruined. Why don't you just do
that instead? Why would you run out and
buy hardware that's going to be
quadruple the price next year and run
your own models and have fun and do cool
things? Why would you do cool things?
Listen to me. Stop the consumerism. Stop
the consumer. What do you own Apple
stock? You're telling people to buy Mac
minis when you own Apple stock? No. Buy
a VPS. Buy a VPS and get all your
information exposed.
[ __ ] buy Mac Mini. Who gives a [ __ ]
Holy f What is happening? I don't know,
man.
I don't know, man. Who knows? Who knows?
Uh, can I use M2? You can use Mg5. Who
cares? You can use anything. People are
running on a Raspberry Pi, which cost
five bucks.
How much can you actually accomplish
with Mac Mini versus Mac Studio? How
limited are you? You're not limited at
all with Mac Mini. You're not limited at
all. Here's why I'm buying a Mac Studio.
Here's why I'm buying a Mac Studio. I
want to run multiple local models that
all power my Claudebot. Right? Imagine
this workflow.
Imagine this workflow. And is what I'm
about to say possible on a Mac Mini?
What I'm about to say probably is
possible, but
I like the idea of doing this all
locally. I record a YouTube video and
you can write this down. Write this
down. I record a YouTube video.
It downloads onto my computer from the
recording.
The moment it hits my computer, there's
a local model on my Mac Studio watching
my downloads folder specifically for
video downloads. It sees I downloaded
this video I recorded off that I
recorded for YouTube and it immediately
gives it hands it off to a local AI
model that processes the entire video
and takes the transcript. It then takes
the transcript and hands it to another
local model who then uh builds the
description for the video and shows the
bookmarks of like or the chapters of
every part of the video, right? And then
it hands that off to Flux, which is a
local uh image model that then takes
that transcript and builds an op an
option of 10 different thumbnails for
me,
which then hands it off to an audio
local model that then uh converts the
audio to 20 different languages, right?
And then takes all of that, the
thumbnails, the translations, the
transcripts, organizes it into a neat
folder on my computer that I then just
can quickly upload and we're good to go.
and it does all that in like 30 seconds.
That's why I'm buying a Mac Studio so I
can automate these multiple models doing
multiple things at the same time on 512
GB of memory
now. If you're not doing power workflows
like that, you probably don't need a Mac
Studio with 512 GB of memory. Right?
For 99% of use cases, for 99% of people,
you probably don't need that. You
probably, you know, that's not a
workflow you want to do.
But
I want to do it, so I'm doing it. Who
cares? Listen, you got 18 months to
escape the permanent underclass.
Actually, I take that back with I I
changed my timelines. Before Claudebot,
my timeline was 18 months to escape the
permanent underclass. With Claudebot, my
timeline is 12 months to escape the
permanent unclass. You have 12 months.
In six months, I think Claudebot goes
mainstream in the corporate world. Then
jobs start getting taken away. And in 12
months, it's apocalypse. You have 12
months to escape the permanent
underclass. Um,
how much Adderall does this guy take? I
took Adderall once in my life. I took
Adderall once in college uh because I
wanted to I wanted to see what that was
about. And also, I had really bad grades
in college. I had a 2.4 GPA in college.
So, I'm like, "Oh, I'm getting bad
grades. Might as well take Adderall."
Uh, and I took an aderall in college and
I didn't eat or sleep for three days.
Uh, I felt like a god. I felt like I
could accomplish anything. I felt like I
was king of the world. Uh but at the end
of the three days, I went, "This
probably isn't healthy. I haven't eaten
or slept in three days and I still feel
at full energy. This probably isn't
healthy." And I immediately took the
bottle of Adderall and threw it away. So
to answer your question directly, Brad
Lindenberg 1339, uh how much Adderall
does this guy take? One Aderall in
college.
I stopped Adderall after Claudebot.

You'll stop doing drugs. Period.
What do you think of Nvidia AIP PC? I
think it's great. There are strengths
and weaknesses to running your AI on uh
Nvidia chips and Apple chips. There's
strengths and weaknesses to each. They
each do things better than the other.
For instance, you're not running Kimmy K
2.5 on Nvidia chips. You would need to
buy $200,000 worth of chips to do it.
With Mac, you can run it on two Mac
Studios for $30,000. Uh, but there's
other things that Nvidia does
significantly better, run significantly
faster, things like that. So, what I
would do is I'd go to your Claudebot and
I'd say, "Hey, I'm thinking about buying
uh chips to run models. What's the
strengths and advant here's what I'm
trying to do? Uh, what are the strengths
and advantages? Which chip should I
use?" Claudebot is the drug. Yes,
Claudebot's the only drug I need. I
stopped doing all drugs once. If you're
on Fent, just get a Clawbot. You'll stop
doing Fent.
How secure is Claudebot? This is like
the number one question I get because
again, just like the people on X are
like, "Oh, don't buy Mac minis. You're
just pumping Apple's stock price."
There's also, "Oh, don't use Claudebot
because you'll die." Right?
Do you have We Here we go. As Spider-Man
would say,
with great power comes great
responsibility,
right? With great power comes great
responsibility. The reason why Claudebot
is so amazing is because it is so
powerful. And the reason why it's so
powerful is it can do anything on a
computer. Now, if you do anything with a
computer, yes, there are things you can
do that are bad, right? There are ways
you can exp if you do the wrong click on
the wrong things on a computer, right?
If you click on the wrong things and you
can expose things, that's bad. That's a
bad thing to do. But is there a reason
why you shouldn't use a computer?
Because you can do bad things. Should we
just Should we stop using anything where
if you use it the wrong way, bad things
happen, right?
I'm drinking coffee for those wondering
why am I so energetic and crazy. Cuz I
drink a lot of coffee. But if I drink
enough coffee, I'll overdose and die.
So, should I stop drinking coffee
because if I drink too much of it, I
could die? No. You just do it
responsibly, right?
Can you ask your clawbot to read all
your emails and then someone emails you
uh a prompt injection that then leaks
all your passwords? Yes, that could
happen.
But is that a reason to not use
Cloudbot?
just because there's a scenario where if
you use it the wrong way, something bad
can happen.
No. If you're so scared to use a tool
because bad things might happen, I have
bad news for you. You're in the
permanent underclass.
The only way you're escaping the
permanent underclasses if you use the
newest and greatest tools. Just do it
responsibly.
Just do it responsibly. Don't do the
things that get you hacked. Don't do
that. And if you're wondering, oh, what
are those things that
get me hacked? Well, first of all, you
can figure them out yourself. If you
stop and you think, oh, what are the
things get me h like you will figure out
some of those best practice like let's
just be and you can also ask your AI.
But two, I will create a security guide.
I will create a security guide and put
it out.
I will create a security guide. But
here's what it comes down to. Your
Clawbot has basically root access to
your computer. And if you allow other
people to talk to your Claudebot, they
now have root access to your computer.
So like security step number one, the
most important of all is just don't let
other people talk to your Claudebot,
right? Don't put it into group chats.
Don't put it in a Discord other people
are in. If you just don't allow other
people to use your Clawbot, you're half
you're halfway there.
Did your viewers jump 5x since live last
stream? Everything's exploded 5x since
the last live stream.
I'm him. I'm the Claudebot guy. I tweet
about Claudebot. I ped a picture of my
Mac Mini. Got 10 trillion views and now
here we are. I'm the Claudebot guy. It
just is what it is. Here's how it
happened. It is what it is. But I will
give a full security guide on Claudebot.
But in the meantime, just don't do
stupid stuff with Claudebot, right? Just
don't do stuff stupid stuff with
Claudebot.
Dopey TV1 with the $2 donation. Thank
you, Dope Boy. That will that'll cover a
Claude Opus prompt. Imagine, that's not
me. It's I'm grateful. I'm grateful for
the $2. I was making a joke.
Imagrateful.
Imagine students using Claudebot for
online homework. I mean, we're we're
we're going to change society. This is
going to change society. I do not
believe this is some sort of trend. The
stupidest people on X
are the ones that go, I just downloaded
Claudebot and it doesn't do anything
special. This is stupid. Don't listen to
people.
And it's like all they did was like
download Claudebot and ask it what the
weather was. And then they go on and
tweet.
They go on and tweet, "Oh, this this
[laughter] is the worst. It doesn't do
anything. I asked the weather and told
me the weather. I could do that in chat
GPT." Well, you're a [ __ ]
You're a [ __ ] You want to see what why
Claudebot's amazing? Show me how you do
this in Chad GBT.
What you're looking at here is a
complete second brain with my Clawadbot
that it built by itself. It built this
by itself. I didn't ask for this. Every
night my Clawudebot builds me something
to improve our workflow. And so two,
three nights ago, it built this second
brain. What is the second brain it
built? It automatically it wrote this
app, this next.js app. And then it built
its own skill that said, "Every day,
record all our conversations into
journal entries and then create
documentation
on important conversations we have." And
so it builds this document viewer
interface for me. It's now writing
journal entries on everything we talk
about every day.
And it's just a self-improving system.
Now, show me how Chad GBT is a
self-improving system. And this is only
one of a hundred use cases I'll show
you. It built this entire interface to
view memories and documents that it
proactively creates based on our
conversations. I didn't write any of
these. It just wrote them.
It just like wrote a document for
workflow improvement ideas. So it
created this interface and started
writing documents on workflow
improvement ideas.
That's incredible.
Please, people on X and YouTube who go,
"Oh, this is just a trend. Chat GBT does
all this." Please show me how you get
chat GBT to do this proactively, without
you asking, figuring out ways to improve
itself by building a second brain system
and then recording all your
conversations and documents and files so
you can review journal entries. Please
show me how chat GBT if anyone on here
if their chat GBT has ever proactively
came up with an idea without you asking
where they built its own app and then
started using that app by itself
proactively. If you can show me your
chat GBT did that in the past I will
give you $10 million right now.
If you can show me that if you show me
I'll give you $10 million.
use used clawbot but not able to use
ooth for and I'm hearing that.
I'm hearing that. Play around with the
API. Use the API a little bit. I'm
hearing good things about Kimmy K25.
Clawed parents can change kids
educational lives. Thank you for the 14
R. Thank you for the 14 R. Rob
Cunningham 25. Clawed parents can change
Oh, 100%.
100%. I can't wait to have a kid so I
can give them their own clawbot that
does stuff for them. 100. Uh, this is
the stupidest thing I read. This is the
stupidest thing I read. No offense,
Infinite Variance, but whenever I see
tweets like this on X, I just like
cringe.
Giving money to Claudebot to trade for
you is the stupidest thing you can do.
Giving money to Claudebot to trade for
you is the absolute stupidest thing you
can do. Claudebot cannot trade for you.
It can't.
It's not that real time where it is
actively every second day monitoring a
stock market and then able to within a
millisecond place a trade. That's just
not it's it's not Claudebot's fault.
It's the underlying AI models fault.
None of the AI models are successfully
trading stocks or crypto. They're not.
Because when you try to programmatically
trade stocks and crypto, what you're
doing is you're going up against Harvard
grads that are getting paid $40 million
a year by Goldman Sachs that have built
systems by hand that trade stocks within
a microscond of everyone else on planet
Earth. That's who you're competing with.
and your Claudebot hooked up with Claude
Opus is not outperforming a one
microscond uh trade bot built by a
Harvard grad who's getting paid $40
million a year by Goldman Sachs. I'm
sorry, but it's just not happening.
Anyone who's telling you, hey, go trade
crypto and stocks with Claudebot is just
trying to get some clicks. That's all
they're trying to do. That's it. That's
all they're trying to do. There's no way
if you Yes, you can get lucky and make
money because yeah, if you just place
random trades, you can eventually get
lucky and make money, but you are you're
playing a losing game. You're playing
Yes, you can go to the blackjack table
and make money,
but over a long enough time period, you
are literally guaranteed to lose money.
So, I would just
I just would not use Clawbot to trade.
You're literally gambling. And if you're
taking the most powerful technology in
the history of mankind and using it just
to gamble, you're wasting your life and
you're wasting your money. Use this to
better yourself. Use this to improve
your life. Use this to learn new things.
Use this to make your life easier. Use
this to help you meet more people. Use
this to improve your business. Right?
There's so many ways to use this to make
your life better. You're going to go and
have a trade fartcoin.
What are we doing people? Thank you for
joining Danny CZ Y RNY 3227.
Is the name change moldbot legit? I mean
if the question is is it like
legitimate? Yes, it is legitimate. They
changed it.
Um is it legit as in do I like the name?
No, I don't like the name. I don't like
the name. I think it's a I just don't I
think it's a I don't like the name. I
don't like the name Moltbot. I think
Claudebot's a significantly better name.
I totally understand why they had to
change it from Claudebot. They literally
just stole the IP from Anthropic. Just
because you change a couple letters
around doesn't mean you you you didn't
steal the IP. It it was IP thefts. I do
not blame Anthropic for coming after
them. That is crazy. Um
I mean, so they they had to change it,
but I don't I mean I don't I don't like
mold, but it is what it is. Whatever.
Who cares? Uh kids voice is so whiny.
deaf being paid by big claw. Oh yeah,
that makes sense. Chris lonzely 72. That
makes sense that I'm being paid by a
free open- source tool. That yeah, they
they are paying me big open- source free
tools is 100% slipping me money. You got
it. Smart man. Smart man Chris Lazini.
100% free open- source tools are paying
me money. That makes a lot of sense.
Uh is there any advantage to running
multbot on GPU as a structure uh as a
service infrastructure? Uh maybe
Neocloud's going to offer hosted Molbot
instances as normies as a business.
There are advantages, but kind of as I
talked about at the beginning of the
stream,
I think it's better to run locally.
There are advantages, quicker setup,
maybe saving money in the short term,
but I think there's a lot of advantages
to running it locally, having full
control over its environment, being able
to watch it live 247. If you're on Mac,
being able to integrate it into all your
other Mac devices, right? If I want to
give Clawbot something to do, Henry,
Henry is my Clawbot. If I want to give
Henry something to do and it's based on
a document or a photo I just took on my
iPhone, I can just airdrop that to my
Mac Mini and he can take it and start uh
doing things with it,
right? And that kind of integration I
think is great. So my recommendation is
local hardware. I think the Mac Mini is
a great device, but you can also just
use old computers if you want to use an
old laptop.
Uh,
what is this?
What is this?
Ammy right now with 500 something. What
currency is that? I either got a ton of
money just now or very little money. I
don't know. But thank you either way. Am
I right now? Thank you. Am I right now
for the 500 of whatever that currency
is? I appreciate it. I need Claude.
Here's what I need. I need Clawbot to
watch my streams and just tell me what
the currencies are that people are
donating me. I don't know what a PLN a
PLN is. I don't know what that symbol is
next to this, but we'll roll with it
anyway.
Thank you for it. I am grateful for
whatever amount of money that is. Can
you give us a cost breakdown? How many
tokens is the bot costing you? I saw a
video. I assume since it's orange,
that's a decent amount of money. So,
thank you. Uh I mean, even if you send
me 5 cents, thank you. That means a lot.
Can you give us a cost breakdown? How
many tokens is that bot costing you? I
saw a video today of a dude saying he's
spending $300 a day via API. Also, have
you tried using other APIs that are not
Clawed? Uh cost breakdown,
$200 a month for the Claude
uh subscription, Claude Max, $250 a
month for chat GBT subscription.
I use Codeex 2 uh Codeex
whatever version we're on, 5.2. Codeex
5.2. 2 as the vibe coding tool. So, let
me give you guys a little tip here.
Codeex 5.2
extra high. I use codeex as the vibe
coding tool for Claudebot. What do I
mean by that? I Polish money. Thank you
for the Polish money. I appreciate that.
Thank you. I appreciate that.
I'll have to visit Poland sometime. I
hear it's beautiful. Shout out Poland.
500 Polish zodi equals $141.
You donated me $141.
Holy hell. You don't need to do that.
Thank you very much. That's a lot of
money. There is no need for that. Thank
you. Very kind of you. I don't need it,
but thank you. Um
I appreciate that. Very nice of you. Uh
means a lot. Truly means a lot. Um,
oh yeah, tip for you to save some money.
If you're you if you're still on the
Claude subscription powering your thing,
tell it first of all, if you're using
Chad GBT, if you have any sort of chat
GBT subscription, uh even if it's 20 the
$20 a month subscription, install the
codec cli and then go to your Claudebot
if you're using Opus for your Cloudbot
and say, "Please use codec cli for any
coding activities."
Right? And so what that'll do is instead
of you using your clawed subscription to
not only be the brain but also the
muscles, the arms, you know what I'm
saying? Like in instead of having Opus
being both the brain and the coder, Opus
will be the brain and Codeex will be the
coder, which will save you a ton of
tokens. Save you a ton. So, that's a
really good tip if you're on the API and
it's also a really good tip if you're on
the subscription because then it'll look
less suspicious to Anthropic and they
won't kick you off.
He said it, not me.
Uh, when will you start showing
workflows? Hey, Chris DL2QF,
this is my stream. If you want to if you
want to stream with workflows, pop open
your own YouTube stream and we'll see
who tunes in. All right. At the moment,
I'm answering questions. Who when are we
going to start showing workflows? I just
went through a spectacular workflow. Did
I not just start showing a spectacular
workflow with the codeex? That's a great
workflow I just gave you there. Let's be
grateful. Let's be grateful. I think
that was a great workflow.
Jesus, would Olama work? Yeah, if you
what if you Yeah, if you run local
models, do it through through O Lama,
you could hook that [ __ ] up to Cloudbot
100%. I mean, that's I think that's the
future we're heading towards.
I think that's the future we're heading
towards is um running local models. Here
we go. You guys want a workflow? I'll
give you a workflow. I'll give you a
workflow. Um
running local models and using that as
the tools for your Claudebot. Imagine a
world where you have your local cloudbot
powered by local models doing everything
locally and the internet and the AI
companies and all that. The government
can't see what all your models are
doing.
All right. You want another workflow?
Here we go.
Let me take a sip of water. I'm talking
a lot here. My throat's getting a little
dry from all the talking.
You think this is easy shouting into a
microphone for two hours? You think this
ain't easy?
Every morning I get this morning brief
texted to me from my Claudebot. 8 a.m.
It texted to me. My Clawudebot sends
this to me.
What's in this morning brief? Yes,
obviously the weather. Competitive
radar. Every night,
my Claudebot
goes and researches all the other AI
channels on YouTube, right? So, I said,
"Hey, Claudebot, check out my YouTube
channel. See what type of content I
make, what I talk about. Check out the
transcripts. See what I'm about." And
then I said, "Do research every night
and see if other creators are posting
videos that outperform their average."
Right? So basically find outliers on
YouTube in my category. And so
competitive radar,
it found a few outliers from Matthew
Burman. Again, shout out Matthew Burman,
great AI creator. Um, but my clawbot
found Matthew Burman, posted a few
outliers.
Mission control. So this is a cool one.
My Claudebot has access to my to-do
list. So, I use things three for my
to-do list because it has a connector
for things three. And I have it do three
things with things three. Three, three,
three, three, three. Three things with
things three. Whs
it worked on last night. So, these are
tasks Henry is doing for me proactively.
I didn't even ask them to do. Henry, my
clawbot's doing these three things
proactively. It talks about what I need
to do or uh what what what
no what Henry needs to do and what it's
going to do today for me, right? So, he
needs to write my weekly newsletter and
continue work on mission control and it
tells me what I need to do today. So,
what's on uh what's on my to-do list?
That's amazing.
So, it basically takes my to-do list,
lets it know what he's going to do, what
he already did for me while I was
sleeping, and what I need to do today.
It finds trending stories on the
internet based on my interests. Right?
New York Times, five ways people are
using Claude Code, 5 days old. The
register, Ralph Wiggum Loop, story
circulating, right? And then it gives me
ideas for today
based on my interest in what I should be
doing. So, it recommends me tasks to do
today.
How did I set up this morning brief?
I asked Claude Code to do it or uh
Claudebot to do it. I went on Claudebot.
Probably why they're probably why they
sent a season desist, right? I keep
confusing Cloudbot for Claude Code.
Probably why they send a season desist.
Anyway, uh here's what you do. You want
to set this up. The video I'm dropping
in a couple hours covers this. So, it
covers the exact prompt. I'll have the
prompt in the description, but basically
what I say is
send me a morning brief every morning at
8 a.m. Tell me the weather where I am.
Tell me, go on my YouTube and find
competitors that make similar content.
Let me know if they have any outliers.
Take a look at my to-do list. Take care
of a few tasks. Let me know what you
took care of. Let me know what you can
take care of. And let me know what I
need to take care of on my to-do list.
find trending stories online based on
what you know about my interests and
then give me a few ideas for the day
that will make it productive. And then I
hit enter and Claudebot goes and does
it.
People saying, "Oh, Claudebot's nothing
special. Chad GBT can do this.
Please show me how Chad GBT can do this.
Please show me how Chad GBT can send me
this morning brief where it does tasks
for me overnight because it's connected
to my to-do list and can see what I need
to do and it'll just automatically do
those things while I'm sleeping and then
research other YouTube channels, found
outliers, recommend task for it to do
during the day and recommend tasks for
me to do. If you can show me how chat
GBT can do that, I'll give you $10
million.
$10 million. Oh, but Claudebot's
useless. That That's useless. what I
just showed you.
Bro, you actually crack me up.
What am I a clown? I crack you up. What
am I a clown? Oh, I'm a clown.
I think that Claudebot has gone to your
head. I think your face has gone to your
head. Alex, what do you think about
Gemini's model with Claudebot? It's It's
fine for a tool. It's fine to be used as
a tool. The way I like to think about
Claudebot is you have the brain and you
have the muscles, right? The you have
the with Clawbot you have the brain and
you have the muscles. The brain is what
you talk to. The brain decides which
tools to use. The brain is the one that
you know wakes up and does things for
you. The brain is what figures out how
to be proactive for you. The best brain
of all time is Claude Opus 4.5. And then
you have the muscles, right? So the
brain goes, "Oh, I need to create
thumbnails for his YouTube videos." And
then it uses the Gemini
Nano Banana Pro, whatever the hell
they're calling it nowadays to make
those thumbnails. That's the muscle. You
know what I'm saying? Or it's like, oh,
I need to build this app. I'm going to
use codec cli. That's the muscle.
So, what do I think about Gemini model
with Claudebot? It's good as used for
some muscles. I wouldn't use it as the
brain unless you're uh, you know,
financially, you want to be financially
tight. You know, you don't want to spend
the money on Opus, so you use Gemini,
which they've they give you free stuff
out the wazu Google because they have 10
trillion dollars locked up. [snorts]
Arthur Vä
says, "Claudebot is shisel
ASF."
Oh, as F. Okay, I got it. The project is
cool, but it looked like credentialed is
credential is leaked. Guys, don't use
it. It's funny. I feel like every
account that goes online and goes,
"Clanbot's dangerous. Don't use it has
like this profile picture, the like
the the casual but not casual
and then like some cringe filter on the
face." I feel like every account that
says, "Oh, you might leak everything if
you use Claudebot. Don't use it." has
like this profile picture that like I'm
trying to be like an online guru. Um,
don't listen to other online gurus
advice. Only listen to my advice. Like I
feel like this is like the the profile
picture of every single one of those.
Like the broccoli top like it might leak
a password. Don't use the most powerful
technology of all time because it might
leak a password. So don't do it.
Don't do it. Don't. or uh like when Chad
GBT first came out. Don't use Chad GPT.
They're spying on you. They'll leak.
Everything you say to it will be leaked.
Don't talk to chat GPT.
Like, what are we talking about here?
Claudebot is crap because it looks like
your credentials leak. What are you
talking about?
What are you talking about?
Don't use the internet.
You might be hacked. If you use the
internet, someone someone might hack you
if someone if you use the internet.
Don't use the internet. It you might get
hacked.
What are you talking about?
$5 Hill Phantom. Thank you, fellow
YouTuber here. Keep keep up the good
work. I am using Miniax 2.1 and is
awesome, mate. I love it and refuse to
not call it Claude as I'm the same way.
It's like when they switched it from
Twitter to Axe. Like, bro, you really
calling it X? Come on, dude.
She's Twitter, baby. [laughter] It ain't
X, it's Twitter. Although, I do call it
X now. I do call it X now, which I think
will happen with Claudebot. Eventually,
I will call it Moltbot, but for the
foreseeable future, I will be calling it
Claudebot. And every one of my titles
will say Claudebot.
Can you make a complete masterass to set
up Claudebot as an ultra secure? Listen,
you don't you don't need to do the
SLMbot. You don't need to do
clawbot/maltbot.
Just say clawbot or say maltbot. We
don't need to I'll save you some
keystrokes. You don't need to do I I'll
know what you're talking about. Whether
you say clawbot or moltbot, I'll know
what you're talking about. Could you
make a complete master class to set up
Claudebot with an ultra security? Yes, I
could do that and I plan on doing it. I
I do plan on making a security focused
uh video 100%. Thank you, by the way,
Hill Phantom. That means a lot. $5 a lot
of mine. Thank you very much. Uh, and
I'm gonna check out your YouTube, Hill
Phantom. I'll check it out right after
this. I appreciate that.
Alex is based. Subscribe. You're based.
Gemini 1546. You're based, brother.
Saps. I mean, listen,
listen. If you don't want to use it,
that's totally fine. If you don't want
to use Claudebot,
totally fine. You'll just have to deal
with the fact you'll be in the permanent
underclass forever.
That's all.
That's it. That's it. You're being dumb
right now, says Rocky. Okay. Thank you.
Appreciate that.
The LinkedIn in cool guy. Yeah. Like
every LinkedIn creator on Twitter who
like here's 20 ways to grow on LinkedIn
and then like a 50 tweet thread on
Twitter that gets four likes is telling
you right now not to use Clawbot.
reply link below and I'll DM you my
LinkedIn guide.
Every single one of those people are
telling you not to use Claudebot right
now because it might leak your
credentials,
dude. Crazy. But I have taken what has
taken me weeks to and in two days.
Claudebot rips through it and gotten me
out of valley of troubleshooting. You're
right. Claude is a hammer. Claudebot
handler. EXACTLY.
>> [applause]
>> I MEAN, IT'S CRAZY, RIGHT?
There's a tremendous amount of people
like Java being 252 and myself who use
this tool. It's dramatically improved
their life. It's dramatically saved them
time. In my case, in a lot of other
cases, it's made them more money
and are like, "Wow, look at this. This
is incredible. Look how much this is
improving my life." And then you got
people that go online and are like, um,
I asked it to tell me the weather. Chat
GPT can do that, too. This is pointless.
This is a scop. This is just a trend.
Chat GPT can do this.
Use my N8N workflow link down below for
my N8N master class. For only $4,000,
I'll teach you how to sit at your
computer for six hours putting together
nodes and connectors to the nodes so
that you can get an NADN workflow that
tells you what your latest email is.
Check out my NAND workflow.
What are we talking about here? NAN.
Who the hell is using NAN anymore in the
world of Claudebot?
Jesus. Josh Adams 8761 with the 499.
Thank you so much, Josh Adams. Ignore
the haters. Your enthusiasm for these
tools, which I share, is extremely
entertaining.
Well, that's what we go for here, baby.
That's what we do on the channel. We go
we try to educate. We try to entertain a
little bit. We try to make it fun. We
want to make the learning fun. If you're
if you're not trying to have fun during
all this, then what's the point? Why get
a Mac Mini? Uh because it's fun. Why
can't we have fun up in this?
Why am I not allowed to change my life
with Claudebot and have a little fun?
So, I want a Mac Mini and now I want a
$10,000 Mac Studio. Let me have a little
fun.
Will I download a local model that'll
only be 5% the performance of Claude
Opus and I'll spend $10,000 to get the
computer running? Yes. Will it be fun?
Yes. So, who cares?
[snorts]
I'm here because you call the stupid
people out directly laughing my ass off.
I mean, what are you supposed to do?
Ignore them? If you leave the stupid
people unchecked, they're just going to
be stupid people. I'm doing them a
favor. If I don't call out their
stupidity, they're just going to keep
being stupid. If you call out their
stupidity, then they'll change and
they'll get better and they'll improve
their lives and they'll thank me and
they'll thank us, the Finnf Fam. We now
have 600 people watching this. You're
all in the Finn. If you're watching this
right now, you're in the Finnf Fam.
Welcome to the Finnf Fam. Stupid people
are allowed in the finfam. We'll just
correct them, right? We'll just correct
them. We'll show them the way.
Best local model for Claudebot for 16
gigabytes VRAM, 24 GB VM. I think you
can use um
like GLM 4.7 flash. I think I might be
wrong, but I mean I'm going to be honest
with you. Either way, with 16 gigabytes
of VRAM, you're you're
there's basically going to be no useful
use case for you that you'll be able to
do. It'll be Did I miss a donation of
$20? I feel like I just looked up and
there was a bubble that said $20 and
then it disappeared.
Oh, there is. Muhammad, my bad. I'm
going to get to you in a second. I just
found it. Um, what I was saying was I I
think there's um
there's just with 16 gigabytes of VRAM,
I don't think there's many workflows
you'll be able to do with a local model
that will improve what you're doing.
Just to be honest, I still think you
should do it because I think it's you
should tinker. Tinkering is fun and you
should have fun. Fun should be a big
part of why you do anything. I'm a big
proponent of fun. The the anonymous
accounts on Twitter and the anonymous
people in the chat that go, "Oh, don't
do that. That's stupid." that you're
going to do bad things.
You shouldn't do things for the fun of
it. Tell them to kick rocks. Have some
fun. So, do I think you'll be able to do
anything interesting with 16 gigabytes
of VRAM? Probably not, but it'll be fun,
so who cares? Muhammad, for $20. Thank
you, Muhammad. Longtime viewer. Before
we were having 600 people concurrent in
the live stream, Muhammad was watching.
When Claudebot compacts, it sometimes
suddenly forgets the context and starts
acting like a fresh session. suddenly
asked him like, "What are we building as
a Mac Mini? Any solutions for this?"
Mohamad, that was the best $20 you spent
in your entire life because I have the
most direct solution you'll ever see in
your entire life right now.
I have the answer to to your question of
do I have a solution? The answer to that
is yes.
You ready? The chat's moving very fast,
so you might miss this. So, everyone who
wants to solve the problem you see right
now on your screen, look at the chat
because I'm about to give you the
solution.
Maybe I'll put in the description as
well. Uh, I'll put in the descript. It's
probably a better way to do it to put in
the subscription. Um, but just for the
fun of it, I'm going to put it in the
chat just to see people have to stare at
the chat. It'll re If you're doing
something else right now, this will
re-engage you with the stream because
I'm putting this in the chat. Um, you
give this prompt I'm about to paste into
the chat to your Clawbot, it immediately
fixes that issue. The prompt I'm about
to give you immediately fixes the issue.
You ready? Here it comes. Five, four,
three. Is it pasting in? What's going on
here? It didn't paste in. One second.
Pause.
Oh my god, I almost copied and pasted
the wrong thing in. Holy crap. Um, that
would have been bad. All right, here we
go. Copy, paste. Here we go. You ready?
Boom.
There it is. Uh, split it into two
comments. I'll put it in the
description, too. Here. Here's what I'll
do. Let me put it in the description.
Uh, so here's this story. There are two
memor
>> Siri, stop. Siri, shut the [ __ ] up.
Jesus Christ. Is there any worse
technology? Isn't that kind of That's
kind of funny if you think about it.
We're on this stream talking about the
technology that Siri should have been
and my dumbass HomePod starts talking to
me out of nowhere spouting some
[ __ ] How that's that's pretty
ironic. Anyway, that's pretty ironic. Uh
let me um
how to fix your memory prompt. Here we
go. You ready?
Save. It's now in the description.
Basically, uh, you take the prompt I
just put into the description of this
live stream
and you copy and paste that into
Claudebot. There are two
there are two memory features inside
Claudebot that are by default
not enabled for some reason. For some
reason, there are two memory features
inside Claudebot that are not enabled.
So, if you go in and you take the
prompt,
I just paste it into the description
and you hit enter.
I'm trying to show you if I can show you
the output. Uh,
it will tell you. It will it will fix
your memory. It will fix your memory.
So, take the prompt. There you go. Best
$20 you spend your life. Check out for
the prompt in the description below and
put it into your cloud bottle. Fix your
memory. Just like that. It enables two
features. It enables memory flush where
right before your context gets wiped
with every compaction, it saves
everything important from the
conversation and puts it back into
context.
And then it also enables session memory
search where your AI can search through
every conversation it's ever had for you
had with you, even the ones it no longer
remembers to look for relevant context
if you say something it forgot.
Uh, massive improvement. Take the take
the prompt from down below. I installed
Claudebot. Will we be able to watch this
live later? Yes. Chimra Chimra Connor.
Yes.
I installed Clawbot inside AWS EC2.
That's fine. That's fine. You totally
can do that. I have a video showing you
how to do that. My last video shows how
you do that. Totally fine. You're
allowed to do that. My preferred way of
using Claudebot
is uh
is Mac Mini. I think doing it I think
doing it locally using it locally is so
much more fun.
So much more fun.
And I think it's more secure by default.
Right? When you install on e uh EC2,
when you install on EC2, it's by default
not secure.
So you have to do secure things to you
have to do like a bunch of things. Uh I
Java being 252 with the 199. I call mine
jackbot and will hit jackpot with
claudebot.
[applause] I don't know what the hell
you just said to me, but I love it. It
sounded nice. It sounded nice when you
said it.
It sounded nice when you said I
appreciate the 199 Java Bean 252
Claudebot for the home assistant too.
It's amazing says Phil Blancet. That is
a project I want to do.
That's a pro. Should we talk to Claude
about about it right now? I would love
to. Uh,
I'd love to hook it up to my HomePod.
Just real quick though, as a warning
about that for your home assistant. Just
know if you make it so you can talk to
it on your HomePod or your home
assistant, you are giving a technology
that is full access to everything on
your computer onto the HomePod. So,
anyone who talks to it now has full
access to your computer.
So, just know that Michael Pearlman
3623, my old friend. My old good-looking
friend. Welcome. Welcome back to the
club. Welcome back to the club. I
appreciate that. I appreciate that.
Welcome back to the com club. Uh, let's
see. I'm way behind on chat. Let's get
back to it. Claude, someone's mowing the
lawn outside my window. I'm in the
middle of a Claudebot live stream. What
are you doing? Can people hear that?
Claude broke its leg. I told it to fix
its leg. It fixed its leg. It's
invincible. I'm in love. Hill Phantom,
thank you for the $5. I appreciate that.
You might have already answered this,
but are you still using it with the
Clawed account and not worried about
getting banned? I am still using it with
my Claude account. If I get banned, I
get banned. That's life, baby. That's
life. Who car? You can't live your life
worried what AI subscription you're
going to get banned from. Just live your
life. Just live your life. I'm not going
to sing Rihanna on this. That'd be
that'd be a silly move. Um, is it now
called Maltbot? Yes. Can I ask how much
is the whole Claudebot cost you?
Briefly.
I don't know if I understand the
question, but I assume you're asking how
much it cost me. I paid $200 a month for
Claude Max. I paid $250 a month for Chat
GBT Pro. And I paid $600 for this Mac
Mini. And I just paid $8,500 for a Mac
Studio that I'll be running it on.
That's my Claudebot lawn mower. Did you
send your Claudebot over here to mow the
lawn during my live stream? Apex
Invader. Is that what you just did? You
sick son of a [ __ ] Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding me? You want to see what
else?
You want to see what else we built here?
um
CRM. We built a CRM.
Imagine this world. Imagine this world
right here. This is what we built here.
It built this proactively. By the way, I
did not ask it to build a CRM. It just
built a CRM. But it built V1 of it.
Imagine a world where your Claudebot is
monitoring your emails, monitoring your
text messages. Imagine a world where it
can monitor everything you do. Sounds
scary, but bear with me here.
And in real time,
records the names of who you're talking
to, records the conversations you're
having with that person, records the
important details, records the follow-up
items you need to do, the to-do items,
records where you are, what time it is.
in real time updates the records of that
user for of that person for you.
Maybe if you have some sort of camera
device on you, it auto takes a picture
of them so you can remember uh so you
can remember what they look like.
And then you go back a week later and
you say, "Hey, did I talk to this
person?" It goes, "Yeah, here's who that
person is. Here's what you talked to
them about.
[snorts]
That's pretty sick. I brought a tissue
this time just in case I could blow my
nose. So having to walk away for a
minute.
That wasn't a fart. That was me blowing
my nose. [snorts]
Bro dresses like a tech bro but is
charismatic like a streamer. Lols. You
think I dress like a tech bro? Wow.
Voice crack alert. You talk for two
hours and you're tell me your voice
doesn't crack.
You think I dress what? Cuz I wear a
quarter zip. This is Amy Leon Door
Tamara Connor. This is Amy Leon Door.
This ain't tech bro outfit.
This is like New York City street style.
Am I living in Silicon Valley? Yes.
Is all I talk about AI? Yes.
Do I talk to women? No.
Am I addicted to Arc Raiders? Yes.
That doesn't make me a tech bro. This is
Amy Leon Door.
So don't don't come at me with that.
Don't come at me with that. All right.
CRM,
imagine that world. I think that's a
reality in the next 12 months. Every
conversation you have, all your text
messages to this person gets appended
into here. all their notes, it makes
tags. Oh, coworker or exfollower. Every
like you make on one of their posts goes
in here. Every reply they put on one of
your posts goes in here. Every video you
watch of theirs on YouTube goes in here.
Imagine that world.
Imagine that world.
Mr. Wormbbeast, welcome to the Finnf
Fam. Appreciate you, bud. Thank you for
joining. What have you given Moltbot
access to? Files, email, text. Would I
be stupid to set up on my personal
MacBook Pro? says Aren Tori Johnson7913.
I have not given it access to email my
emails. I have not given it access to my
text messages. I have given it access to
my basically complete file system.
Why have I not given it access to files
or email or to uh emails and texts?
because
I want to be 100% certain before I do
that
that it it the protections are in place
for it not to get prompt injected.
So, there's a couple issues. One, I am a
I'm a target. Let's just be honest,
right? I got follow like all the North
Korean hackers would love to hack me
because I got followers and if they hack
me, they can put their links for their
crap on my ex in YouTube. So, I'm a high
target because I have followers, right?
And so,
there's just a lot of heat right now.
There's just a lot of heat. And so, I
don't want to make I get I I get a
hundred fishing attempts a day. I get a
hundred fishing attempts a day. If they
found out it was monitoring like a
specific channel, they would I'd get a
thousand prompt injection attempts on
that channel. So, I don't
I'm going to be honest at the moment. I
don't think there's a ton of massively
compelling use cases for it to monitor
your text messages,
right? Like I just went over this use
case right here with the CRM. I think
that's a very compelling use case, but
I'm not ready. I just don't think I'm
ready to implement it just yet. I'm
building the structure for it so that
when I'm ready, I can just click go and
it goes. Um, but while it's just a
four-week old open-source project, I'm
not ready to give it access to the
emails and texts just in case of
fishing. You know what I'm saying? But
even without access to your emails and
texts, I think it is an incredibly
compelling, useful, high value tool.
Even with just access to your file
system and the ability to create
documents, I still think it's a highly,
highly compelling, useful tool that
everyone should be using.
Arc Raiders. Ra, it's too addicting. I
had to stop myself. You always play Arc
Raiders. No, I refuse. I had to stop
myself. When it first came out, I played
it non-stop.
Non-stop. If you play Arc Raiders
non-stop, you're not escaping the
permanent underclass. I have to escape
the permanent underclass. I have to.
Once I escape the permanent underclass,
I'll play Arc Raiders all day, baby. I
don't drink. I don't do drugs. Once I
escape the permanent underclass, who
cares? But until then, like if you're
wasting your time, which I'm not going
to say I'm perfect this Friday night,
I'm probably going to boot up Arc
Raiders and drop in a Stella Montis for
an hour or two. Like, I'm going to be
honest, Friday night, I'm probably
dropping in the Stella Montis with my
Stitcher 4
in my blued out kit, right?
But I can't make it a daily activ. It
used to be a daily activity. I had to
stop. I have to escape the permanent
underclass.
should have made your Claudebot a woman.
Problem solved. Now you talk to women.
It's a good point. I did give Henry a
female voice by accident. So for a
little bit there, I guess I was talking
to women, but then I changed it to a
male voice.
Alex, I worked at Google for eight years
in Mountain View and just left a couple
years ago. I wish I could have met up
with you while I was there, giving you
some free lunch. Michael J. Pearlman, I
would have met up. I'm going to be
honest, I'm probably not meeting up with
99% of the freakazoids who say, "Hey,
let's meet up." Michael J. Pearlman, I
said this to you from day one when I
first started streaming like 6 months
ago. I said, "I feel a connection with
you through your profile picture. I
would have met up for free lunch, but
only if the lunch is free. If I'm
paying, I'm not even acknowledging your
existence.
Can you totally have it pitch a bunch of
chicks on sites for you now?" Says Mick
8001. What the hell does that mean? What
do I like you saying? Can I have it like
control my Tinder and have it match with
a bunch of chick? Is that what you're
saying? I guess technically. Yeah. Dude,
just sub. I love the Henry story and I'm
so pumped to get a moldbot.
I think it's molt, not moldbot. Dude,
moldbot sounds like something else.
Myself, your memory tip goes so hard,
bro. Godzilla G7J, you go so hard, bro.
You go so hard. You're one of the
hardest goers I've ever seen in my life.
You think it's worth it to live in
Silicon Valley? I mean, if you're
looking to make connections like in the
tech industry, I think you have no
option to be honest with you. And if you
are looking to live in beautiful weather
year round, then yes.
Two days ago, I checked the weather in
New York City. It was negative4 degrees
and 16 inches of snow. And then I looked
outside and it was 70° and I went
swimming. So like if that is of any
interest to you, then yeah, you might
want to move to Silicon Valley. Why is
Claudebot absolutely everywhere? It has
to be mass- paid sponsorships. A city
where why is it so hard
for people not to understand that? Like
why is the scenario? Let me let me let
me give you a scenario. Cityear 7946.
Let me just paint you a picture real
quick.
an opensource
free tool comes out that is more
powerful than any other tool that's ever
existed and it saves you hours of time
and it saves you money and it gets
things done you've never experienced
before.
Just let's let's play pretend for a sec.
Let's just say that happens. Let's
pretend like a free open-source tool
comes out that gives AI capabilities
it's never done before. that gives it
the best memory system of all time that
allows it to work proactively and do
things while you're sleeping. Let's just
pretend like that came out. If for
instance something like that came out,
would it be that crazy if people went on
Twitter and tweeted, "Hey, this is
pretty awesome." Would that be in Would
that be crazy? Would that be insane?
Would that be an insane thing to do?
Would it be insane to make a YouTube
video and it starts off by going, "Hey,
this tool is awesome." Would that be
crazy?
If they came out with a free open-source
tool
that's not built by some evil
corporation that is dramatically better
than every other tool out there that
dramatically improves your life, would
it be crazy if like a few people online
tweeted, "Hey guys, check this out. It's
pretty cool." Would that is that crazy?
Or
does that mean everyone's getting paid
by that? Let me repeat, free
open-source tool.
Is it crazier if that tool comes out and
people go online and get excited? Or is
it crazier
if somehow that free open source tool is
sponsoring a ton of people? That tool
that makes zero dollars is now doing
mass paid sponsorships. Which scenario
is crazier in your head? people enjoy a
revolutionary tool or mass paid
sponsorships from a tool that's open
source and free and not making any
money. So you you choose to believe this
one. This is the one you choose to
believe that this free open source tool
that's making zero dollars is paying a
bunch of people to tweet about it.
That's more realistic to you than people
like the tool and they tell others about
it. This is more realistic to you over
here. That's the one you're going with.
That's your That's your hypothesis. City
wear. That's the hypothesis. Got it.
Okay. That's fine. Whatever. You You
roll with that. You have fun with that
one.
Crazy. You have fun with that one.
[sighs]
Bro has been yapping for an hour and
still has not shown us how to use it or
even install.
Says, "Deadbeat Street."
Dead beat Street. Was your expectation
when you joined this live stream that
I'd sit here and show you how to install
Claudebot when you can go on YouTube and
there's 98,000 tutorials of how to
install Claudebot on it
or
I don't know what the other option was.
I guess that was just a one part that
wasn't a multi-art question. That was
just a one- part question. Your
expectation when coming in this live
stream is I just sit here and show you
how to install claw. You think that'd be
interesting? You'd think I'd have 581
concurrent viewers if I sat here and did
the same thing everyone else on
YouTube's doing. Show you how to install
it.
George Soros loves Clawbot. Alex, admit
your connection with him.
No, I respect the uh I respect the pivot
to pure trolling. Right. You started off
you're doing some light jabbing. Now
you're doing just pure trolling. I
respect that. That's what I would do,
too. I respect that. I think that's
good. That's a good one. I like it. I
like it. What are the actual usability
differences between Claudebot on Mac and
Linux? Anything besides messages?
I mean, asking about usability
differences between Mac and Linux.
One is an operating system built from
the ground up by a company that just
tries to make everything as like usable
as possible and the other is Linux. It's
up to you.
If anyone's considering using Linux and
like are concerned about the usability,
just Google search or YouTube search
Linux and see how other people use
Linux. I mean,
I think Mac OS is significantly more
usable. I mean, you're you're going to
be using the computer it's on. Like, I
use the computer it's on. I look at the
files it makes. I edit the files it
makes. I take the scripts it writes and
I upload it. I do the video editing. I
have a video edit, right? So, if you
prefer to use Linux, go ahead and use
Linux.
You know what I'm saying, big dog?
Let's build some cool [ __ ] Didn't I
just show you what I built? My CRM,
my second brain.
I feel like everyone begs, hey, can you
go and chat with your AI for the live
stream? Like, what are you doing? I
haven't seen you chat with the AI once.
And then I sit there and I silently chat
with the AI for 10 minutes and then the
audience just gets cut in half. It's
like, is that what you really prefer?
Like I'm showing you off things I built.
You would you want to watch me chat with
the AI? Is that what you want? You want
to you want to sit here and watch me
type on my keyboard? Is that the
preferred live stream experience you'd
rather have? Because I guarantee the
moment I start typing on my keyboard and
sitting here silently for 15 minutes
going back and forth my AI, the entire
count goes down from 574 to 130.
I'm showing you some I think the good I
think the strength of a live stream is I
can sit here show off what I built show
you what I built the day before in
Claudebot right we built the second
brain the journal entries how it records
everything we talk about and I can read
my journal entries right we talked about
the
we talked about the morning briefs how
it does tasks for me overnight
proactively how It codes for me
overnight proactively. How it researches
other content channels to see what's
trending. Right,
Alex? You need to chill. You will get an
AI psychosis. It's real. No kidding. I'm
I already have psychosis. I'm already
psychotic. Let's get psychotic.
If you're not getting psychotic, what
are you doing? Thank god I recorded my
YouTube video before the stream. I'm
going to have no voice by the end of
this.
I'm preparing a new Mac Mini and plan to
use a new user account and a new email
address. Does this mean I need to create
a new Apple ID for the If you're going
to use
If you're going to use a new user
account, you don't need to make a new
Apple ID. But if you're going to do like
a new,
you know, phone number, new iMessage or
whatever, then yeah, you'll need a new
one. I mean, I I don't
I'm going to be honest. I I don't think
it's worth all that. Like, if you want
to make a new email, then just make a
new Gmail account for it. uh to to do
like a fully separate Apple ID seems
like a little bit of overkill to be
quite honest with you. You know, I don't
do the iMessage system. I use Telegram.
I like Telegram over iMessage for this
stuff.
Uh I think it's kind of simpler. You
know, iMessage is kind of hacky. The
iMessage integration. Apple doesn't want
it integrating with iMessage. Apple
doesn't want it like faking an iMessage
account. So, I just think Telegram is
it's more out of the box. WhatsApp,
Discord, whichever one you want to use.
Mr. VP8KW with the 1999. Thank you, Mr.
VP8KW. I appreciate that, my old friend.
My old uh deaf tones friend. I'm going
to order the open source AI glasses and
put Clawbot on there. Thanks for
everything, my de Oh, my deaf tones
brother. You're one step ahead of me.
You literally changed my life. Thank
you. PS. Congrats on your Pats as well.
Oh, we didn't cover that either.
Patriots Super Bowl, baby. [applause]
We didn't cover that because I was off
on Monday. The reason why I did not live
stream Monday, for those here, I live
stream Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 11:00
a.m. Pacific. Monday, Wednesday, Friday,
11:00 a.m. Pacific. Turn on Subscribe
and turn on notifications immediately.
All 564 people, subscribe and turn on
notifications immediately. I live stream
Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 11:00 a.m.
Pacific. We do cool things like this. I
show you off what I built that week. I
answer questions, you know, we have a
little bit of fun. We joke around. It's
a blast. We vibe code whatever is going
on.
Uh and then in between I release cool
videos like an hour and a half after
this live stream ends, a very cool video
releases where I go over my top five use
cases with Claudebot and I show you how
to build them out. Um
which open- source glasses are you
getting? Which open source AI glasses
are you getting? I'm I'm curious. I
didn't know they have open source AI
glasses. That'd be sick to uh to hear
about.
Hey, Alex. I bought a Mac Mini after
watching your Claudebot video. Is your
browser automation working continuously?
Mine is asking to attach the Chrome
extension for every tab manually. So,
there's two Chrome extensions with
Claudebot.
There's one where it can look at what
you're doing in Chrome, and there's one
where it can control its own Chrome
browser. Those are two separate
tools.
the one you're talking about where it's
asking for permission to see your Chrome
with a Chrome extension is the the one
that you shouldn't be using as much
because there's not as much utility to
it.
That's not the automation. That's not
the automation. That's not the proactive
automation. You want it to spec you want
to specifically ask it to pop open its
own Chrome and do its own thing. That's
where you don't need an extension. It
will just open up its own Chrome window.
So right now it's just trying to use the
wrong Chrome tool. AJ, you got to make
sure it uses the right Chrome tool.
Instead of using Claw on Claudebot, can
I use the regular Claude desktop opus
for Brain and use the codeex 5.2 for
muscle?
I don't know what you're asking me. Are
you Yeah, you can use your claw
subscription. What's the diff what's the
difference between clawed
desktop opus and regular Claude Opus? I
don't understand the difference between
those two. Thanks for your content.
Super helpful stuff. Got my Mac Mini
coming in tomorrow. Hopefully I don't
destroy the world by the end of the
year. Uh Farzad, is this the Farzod uh I
talked to on Twitter? What's up, Farzad?
Man, good to hear from you. Um
I really think this Mac Mini is a smart
way to go with it. I think Mac Mini is a
smart way to go with it. Uh, I think it
allows you to do a lot more. Allows you
more oversight. It's more secure by
default and it's just more fun overall.
It's just more fun. I I re everyone and
their mom's going on X. Why would you
get a Mac Mini? You should get a virtual
private server. Get a virtual private
server. It's like, no, it's more fun to
get a Mac Mini. Shut up. Hey, Alex.
Camping out on Twitch. Shout out Twitch
community. I don't advertise the Twitch
community. Shout out the Twitch
community. Okay, thanks. That reaction
is better. I actually like the stuff,
bro.
For Claudebot specifically, the I'm glad
I'm glad you're I'm glad I gave the
reaction you were looking for. For
Claudebot specifically, the featured
differences between what? The feature
differences between what? I start you.
Can you put like 5% more effort into
writing your chat messages for Claudebot
specifically? The feature differences
like you just left out like probably 10
words you should have put in there. The
feature differences between what? Let's
just put in 5% more effort writing these
chats.
I started with Claudebots and already
have some use cases. Here's Oh, here's a
you need here's people want more tips.
Here we go.
Sip of water. I got a good tip for you.
Let me take the sip. This is called
showmanship. This is called building.
This is called building uh uh
anticipation.
By saying, "I'm about to show you
something." And then I pause and I take
a sip of water from my trendy Oddwala
water bottle. I'm building anticipation
now. You're on the edge of your seat. I
said, "Hey, I got a tip for you." And
then I grab my water bottle and I do
this and I sip
before saying the tip. That is a way, as
we in the business say, to build
anticipation. It's a little bit of
showmanship, and it's a reason why this
live stream currently has 569 concurrent
viewers, because I know how to work the
crowd.
I got a tip for you. That's called
reiteration. So, you drive your point
home. I got a tip for you. You want to
reverse prompt. You want to reverse
prompt. What does reverse prompting
mean? Sometimes I say stuff, I'm like,
damn, that's genius. I got to write that
down. You want to reverse prompt.
More tweets on reverse prompting. Just
taking a note for myself. You want to
reverse prompt. What is reverse
prompting? That's when you basically
have
instead of telling the AI what to do,
you ask the AI what it can do, right?
And what I mean by that is like when you
start up your Claudebot
and you brain dump, so you tell it about
yourself, tell what you're interested
in, you should then go, hey,
what are some really interesting things
you can do for me based on what you know
about me? What are some really
interesting things you can do? Right?
Because the issue a lot of human beings
have is we we struggle sometimes with
creative thinking. We struggle sometimes
with finding the unknown unknowns. You
know what I'm saying? And so you want to
when you're using AI to as much as
possible find the unknown unknowns. And
the way you find the unknown unknowns is
you reverse prompt. You talk to your AI
and you go, "Hey, what based on what you
know, what can you do for me?
I want you to be more helpful. What
information do you need out of me to be
more helpful?
Those are two questions I think you
should ask your AI, your Clawadbot. If
you're on your computer right now, just
do it right now. Or if you're not on
your computer, or if I'm full screen,
because I should be full screen because
I'm the star of the show here. So, you
shouldn't be looking at anything else
except for me. You shouldn't be doom
scrolling on the side. You should be
full focus on me at all times 247.
Wait till after and then you can ask
your clawbot those two questions. But
write down those two questions. Don't
take your eyes off me. Write that down
without taking your eyes off me.
Linux is better these days. Sure, nerd.
Hey, Alex, what are your thoughts about
Kimmy? I need to do a little bit more
testing before I give my final judgment
on Kimmy.
lol at Matthew Burman being watched.
First of all, met Matthew Burman. Great
guy. Very nice guy. Respect the hell out
of him. I set up my Claudebot so that it
searches YouTube every day for other AI
channels and lets me know when other
channels post content that outperform
their average content.
So, if I show you my morning brief from
like two days ago, like you'll see other
AI channels on there.
If I show you my morning brief from like
Oh, I can't even scroll back that far.
Anyway, if I showed you my morning brief
from a couple days ago,
it it looks at every AI channel and when
they post uh videos that outperform
their other videos, it lets me know so I
can see what's trending so I can make,
you know, content about it because
that's an awesome strategy for content.
Elvis Presley moments with the 499.
You're doing great, brother. Thank you.
Thank you. You're doing great. Thanks
for the 499. That means a lot, my man.
Base G Nell's LFG pass. Let's go, baby.
Patriots, we're we're winning it.
Everyone's picking against us.
Everyone's picking against us. Jay
Lancaster QAW with the $25 donation.
Thank you very much. $25. That is very
kind of you. I use Herzner as my VPS and
I installed Claudebot without choosing
the LM or any of the other setup steps.
I didn't know Chad GBT was my only
guide. Well, I can't access the UI now
and I am stuck. I mean, just another
reason.
why you want your own hardware, right?
You don't have control over the
environment in the VPS. If you mess
something up, you're screwed. Like, this
is just another reason. I mean, I just
I' Can you spin up a new one? Like, will
it cost you more money if you spin up a
new one? Why don't you just reinstall
Claudebot? Can you just do do uh Claude
uh onboarding? CL L A WD space
onboarding unless they change did they
change the molt? Do you have to use molt
now in the CLI? Is it now? Is the
package now malt or can you do clawed
onboarding? Either way, whatever the
command is after you install space
onboarding. It should take you through
the onboarding again.
Chat, you guys prefer WhatsApp or
Telegram? I use Telegram for it. I like
Telegram. And they just added on
Telegram, they just added a couple
really cool features for Telegram.
You can do threading and chunking. on
Telegram, you can do threading and
chunking. And so anyone who uses
Claudebot, you know, it's just kind of
one chat, right? You can't have multiple
chats, right? It's just this one chat.
There's no multi-hat interface here.
In Telegram, they just implemented
threading. So, if you go to your bot and
you go into the settings of the bot on
Telegram, you can turn on threading,
which allows you to open up multiple
threads with your one bot, which is very
helpful. And you could also turn on
chunking, which makes it so like with
all your other messaging services, it
just sends you the message when it's
done typing, right? When it gets the
full generation back from the AI, you
now can do chunking where it'll actually
do it word for word. Like if you're
using like chatgbt.com,
which is really, really cool.
Subscribe. Excited for more product.
Thank you. Shu7398.
Alex, I use Clawbot to make me a mashup
app that mixes my rap and rock songs
together for gym mixes. Every day I get
to experience my favorite songs for
first time. That's amazing.
[applause]
Yeah, tell someone show me how Chad GBT
can do that. How it can continuously
remix and build new playlists for you.
Tell me. Someone show me how to do that
on Chad GBT.
Would you create a new Telegram account
or No, you can use your current because
all you're doing is creating a bot
inside Telegram. and it doesn't have
access to your other telegrams. You're
just creating a bot.
Join late. But any has anyone the by the
way
with the amount of trolls I have, the
fact that I just pop open messages on
the screen for everyone to see and I
just start reading them is pretty
ballsy. Let's just let me give myself a
little credit there. The fact that I
have so many trolls and I just spend my
time just opening up messages without
reading them and I just read them out
loud in the middle of the stream.
That's pretty incredible and ballsy.
Join leases. Anyone use databases? Like
you can just throw anything on there and
I'll just start reading. I shouldn't say
that was a stupid thing to say out loud.
Duck DB embeddings. That was stupid. I
shouldn't say my inner thoughts out
loud. To improve their memory management
every management lol join but has anyone
used databases? You can, but I don't
think you need to. Uh, you joined late,
so you missed the prompt. Check out the
description down below. I have a prompt
you should copy and paste into your
Claudebot. You should paste it in. It
improves the memory, the insystem
memory. Uh, I don't think you need
databases to improve the memory. I'm
going to be quite honest with you.
Quick question. What plan do you have
for Claude? Are you seeing token issues
with Claudebot running all the time? No.
I have the $200 Claude Max.
For anyone getting started, my Clawadbot
setup is 2015 Mac Retina running Clawbot
hooked up to Miniax 2.5. Zero
complaints. Yeah, you don't need a $600
Mac Mini. You don't need a $10,000 Mac
Studio, even though that's what I'm
doing.
Not to show off or anything. [laughter]
Um, you can run this on a Raspberry Pi
for like $10.
I would just recommend doing that over a
VPS would be my recommendation.
Like I I just I think having a 2015
MacBook Retina with one gigabyte RAM is
better than that.
Can I run Claudebot on my main iMac but
just sandbox it? Yeah, 100%. You 100%
can do that. I'm not sure how Mac works
though where if you switch accounts, is
it going to kill all the processes from
your other account that you were on?
Right. So, I think what you're asking me
is like, can I just make a new account
on my Mac and it just has its own
account? Technically, you can, but
memory management on Mac might cut it
off.
You know what I'm saying? when you
switch back to your normal account and
you want your Claudebot running 24/7 so
that you can text it at any time on your
phone.
So, I'm not sure about that. I would ask
Chad GBT Vega VGO Ben VGO Ben VGO Ben. I
would ask G Chad GBT how the the how it
works with Mac will kill processes if
you switch between accounts.
Phil Blanchet with the $10 donation.
Thank you, Phil. That's very kind to
you. $10 a lot of money. Thank you very
much, my man. Have you heard if
anybody's been able to get it working
with Salesforce?
I mean, there's a lot of different
I think Salesforce has a good amount of
op a good amount of APIs and is pretty
open. So, I'm sure you can create some
sort of Salesforce connector 100%. I'm
sure you can.
I have very little doubt. I'd have very
little doubt there is some sort of way
to connect it to Salesforce. Uh, I would
just make I would just ask Claude. I'd
ask Claudebot. Go in. Hey, I do this on
Salesforce. How can you help out? How
can we get this going? How can we
connect it? OMI Glass DevKit. I'm going
to write that down. OMI Glass Devkit.
Thanks for that, man. I'm I'm going to
research that.
I had an old ASUS laptop with 32 GB RAM
just sitting in the class. I installed
Ubuntu and now using it for Clawbot.
How's it work? based GL's I'm sure it
worked great that's a great setup for it
use whisper flow and TTS give it
personas and co-host I'm using 11 labs
and the chat GBT voice agent uh API to
talk to it I am setting it up so that I
can call it that'd be great if I can
call it
or I think I'm going to try to have it
do it it build it itself I'm going to
say like hey be great to call you maybe
tonight you build that
Mac Mini behind firewall defaults. Yeah,
I mean that's that's why I'd recommend
going with a Mac Mini is just like by
default you're pretty secure. By default
you're pretty secure with a VPS. By
default you're not secure by default. If
you use a VPS for Claude uh
you you're not secure by default. You
have to do things to become secure with
the VPS. That's why I recommend the Mac
Mini.
Go Seahawks. Get ready to learn Cancun
Patriots says Gemini 1546. Ooh, the
twelves are here. We got the twelves in
the chat. We have the twelves in the
chat. They're here. Go Seahawks. Oh, the
twelves are here.
What happened last time, Gemini? What
happened last time we saw your ass in
the Super Bowl? You tell me.
I have it running on my VPS started with
GLM47 but it effed up writing its own
prompt so switched to my Mac
subscription. Even son opus is huge.
Yeah, it's but here's [snorts] the great
thing like
we just had like yesterday Kimmy K2.5
come out which is the closest we've ever
had to an open-source
Opus, right? Kimmy K25 is very close to
Opus and you can run it on two Mac
studios for $30,000 which sounds like a
lot but the fact that you can run an
Opus type model locally on realistically
$30,000 that is amazing. So
just think about it this way. Think
about where we are a year from now. If
that's where we are now, I think most
people would agree opus is like if opus
was the last AI model we ever see,
that's still pretty amazing. I think
most people would agree. Like I think
most people would agree opus is better
at people better than people at most
things. So if we're here, we got near
Opus open source locally right now.
Think about where we are from a a year
from now.
You might have opus on every device a
year from now.
Store your markdown files in a local
database. Massively reduces and makes
context management smarter and more.
Yeah, I think by default it does that,
does it not?
I wonder if I can use it to create my
own whisper flow, says Franklin 3242.
You absolutely can go to it and ask,
"Hey, I want to build a whisper flow.
Build it for me." I 100% guarantee it
will. I 100% guarantee it will. Did I
hear Oh, should I put Should I do this?
Do people want this? Is this the thing
people want?
Will this make people more secure in the
fact that their chats are getting
through?
I'm always nervous putting the chat on
the screen will get more trolls. People,
oh, I'm going to be able to see my troll
on the screen. I don't know. We're Let's
see how this goes.
Did I hear Twitch mentioned V? Shout out
Twitch community. Shout out Swizz HD.
Captain the Twitch community. I'm using
Clawbot on a Gamer PC 6800X2
Windows 11 WSL with 32 gigs of RAM and a
powerful Ryzen CPU and I feel it could
be limited versus the Mac Mini, right?
No, they'll perform exactly the same. I
mean, it depends. If you're trying to
run local models, I think you'll be
better off than a Mac Mini. I think that
setup will be better than the Mac Mini
if you're trying to do local. I mean,
it's not going to do any sort of really
good local model, but you'll be able to
do kind of the flash models.
The only thing a Mac Mini will be better
at than your setup is just like
usability if you're into, you know,
MacOSS.
Hey chat, ask him for Windows desktop.
It's same as Mac but just hype. Says M
Leaden Drago J Love 4706. What kind of
name
is M Lane Andrago Jay Love 470 whatever.
Uh Mac is just hype. Mac is just hype.
That's that's is that the new consensus
is Apple is just hype.
We're like 40 years into Apple's
existence and we've just determined
after 40 years of dominance being the
biggest company in the world for like 15
years revolutionizing computing. You're
now 40 years in and you're like, "Oh
yeah, that's just hype. That's just
hype." Is that is that is that what
we've boiled this down to?
That's Hey, just bought a Mac. Oh,
that's hype. Mac is hype. Like that's
what
that's just that's just where we're at.
Madego Jay Love 4706 C++ Linux Mac
Microsoft. Like that's that's Oh, Mac
hype.
What's your Claudebot coding stack? Uh,
so I I described this a little earlier,
but the way I like to think about the
Claudebot stack is you have your brain
and you have your muscles, right? You
have your brain and you have your
muscles. The brain is what's drives the
operation. It's what you're talking to
in the chat. And then the brain decides
which muscles to use to build stuff,
right? So your brain's like, "Oh,
you're asking me to code something. Let
me code something. Let me get a coding
model. Oh, you're asking me to do
research. Let me get a model that does
research really well, right? And so my
coding stack for Claude is the brain is
Claude Opus because it's the best brain
in the world for this stuff.
And then the muscle for coding is codeex
uh GPT 5.2 because I don't want to use
all my clawed tokens up and I think
codeex is the second best coding model.
So I use codeex CLI as the coding tool.
So, I literally went to my Clawbot and I
said, "Hey, if you're going to ever code
something or build something, just make
sure to use codec CLI for it. Record
that as like a skill, a coding skill."
And it did that. Now, it uses codec cli
for everything.
Kapich, man, so man, the chat's blown
up, man. So many chats. So many chats.
So many chats. So many chats. So many
chats. Uh,
by the way, great interview with Greg
Eisenberg the other day. Thank you, Fu.
So, it's funny. So, Saturday is when all
this stuff kind of blew up. The Claude
block stuff, right? Like, I think Friday
is when it kind of started getting
picked up on Twitter.
Saturday was like the tipping point. So,
Friday I buy the Mac Mini.
I saw someone tweet about Claudebot. I
do some research and I'm like, "Oh, this
is kind of cool." I go out to the Apple
store. I buy a Mac Mini.
I put Claude, this is Friday. I put
Claudebot on it and I'm blown away. I
think it's the most incredible thing in
the entire world. Like, I'm blown away.
Like truly life-changing realization as
it's doing stuff for me. I tweet a
picture of my Mac Mini. I'm like 247 AI
employee acquired. Goes super viral. two
million likes. And then Saturday,
everything just goes insane. Saturday
morning, I like I wake up at like 6:00
in the morning and I see my post is
starting to go crazy. I'm starting to go
viral.
So, I immediately turn on my camera and
I record a video about Claudebot. I'm
like, "This is getting picked up. I got
to get ahead of this." Uh, so I record a
video on how to use Claudebot, which is
probably the video that a lot of you
people um
discovered me on because it's like by
far my most popular video of all time.
Right. So, I have my video that goes
insane in the membrane viral on
Saturday.
Here it is. Um,
that's kind of the tipping point, right?
366,000
impressions in like three days. It's
made $2,000 of ad revenue on YouTube,
which is pretty crazy. And then Monday
comes and it's like a floodgate opens
yesterday
and I have everyone reaching out to me.
Greg reached out. Greg Eisenberg. If you
don't subscribe to him or follow him, do
it. Fantastic guy, fantastic content,
fantastic channel. Follow and subscribe
to Greg Eisenberg. Jason Calacanis
reaches out. If you watch Allin or any
of his other stuff, uh, this weekend
startups, he reached out. He's like, "We
got to talk about this. Get on the
stream."
And so, it's been a pretty life-changing
few days. Um,
it's been a pretty life-changing few
days. I mean, I've gained like 20,000
subscribers on YouTube, which is
massive. I've gained like 30,000
followers on X, which is massive. Um,
all my websites, newsletters, channels
have all blown up because of this. Uh,
it's pretty amazing. It's pretty
awesome. And basically the I'm not doing
this to gloat. I'm not going through all
this to gloat. But what I'm basically
saying is
what I'm basically saying is go all the
way in.
If you find something you're passionate
about,
if you find something you're interested
in,
don't halfmeasure it. Don't wait to see
what other people are doing.
Don't be passive about it.
Go balls deep as Shu 73993 would say.
Right. Friday, I do re I see Claudebot.
I research. Oh, that's pretty that's
pretty interesting.
I don't halfmeasure it. I go out. I drop
600 on the Mac Mini. I install it.
I I get Claudebot going. I have this
unbelievable realization. Wow, this is
insane. This is crazy. This tech is it,
right? This tech is it. And I go all the
way the f in.
And I sit there on Saturday from 6:00
a.m. to 1:00 a.m. that day. 6 am to 1:00
am that day recording videos, writing
tweets, writing newsletters, coming up
with new use cases,
experimenting, coming up with new
workflows, pushing the limits of
Claudebot. And I've been doing that ever
since. And I've been doing that ever
since. And what happened? Because I went
all the way in because I didn't half
measure it. Things are blowing up.
Things are blowing up.
This is the analytics, right? This is
Saturday
because I went all the way in. Look at
that. This is I mean, let's go to 365.
Last 365 days.
I went all the way in right here.
Look at that line. Watch time last 365
days. Slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly,
slowly. Then all at once, right?
subscribers slowly slowly slowly slowly
slowly slowly then all at once right
I only ever got like a hundred
subscribers a day last few days 5,000
subscribers a day message is this
when you find something you're
passionate about when you're find
something when you find something that
interests you
when you find something that really
I want to say inappropriate things, but
I feel like I'll save that for
offstream. When you find something that
really gets you off, you know what I'm
saying? When you find something that
really gets you off,
go all relentlessly go all the way the f
in. Relentlessly go all the way the f
in. Do not stop.
When you find an obsession, get all the
way obsessed.
Because if you half measure it, someone
who gets obsessed will destroy you.
If you only go halfway in, someone else
is going to kill you.
You know what I'm saying?
If you find something you're interested
in, if you have any
goal around winning in this world, if
you have any goal around coming out
successful, winning, whatever you do,
unless you go all the way the f in,
you're not someone else is going to beat
you who does go all the way the [ __ ] in.
You know what I'm saying?
If you if you're in love with AI, if
you're in love with Chad GBT, if you're
in love with Claudebot, if you're in
love love with programming, whatever it
is, if you're in love with basketball,
if you have any goal or interest in
winning,
you have to go all the way the [ __ ] in.
Otherwise, someone else will destroy
you.

you want like a private workshop link
for the Vibe Coding Academy is down
below. Sam is definitely watching now.
Why? Because I said makes you hard. Is
that what Man, you guys are make no one
in the AI industry reaches out to me
because of stuff you guys getting me to
say stuff like this. You think Sam
Alman's going to reach out to me now
that you made me say all these stuff
things out loud? He's never going to
reach out to me now
because of comments like this, Eric.
I'm going to have to keep doing all this
with zero support from the AI industry
because of this, Eric.
Whatever.
