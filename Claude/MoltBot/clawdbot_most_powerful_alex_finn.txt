I've seen the future and it is right
here on this Mac Mini. Over the last 48
hours, I've been playing with an AI tool
that has completely changed my life.
It's called Clawbot and is a 24/7 AI
agent employee that works for you all
day and night. It can control a
computer. It has infinite memory and it
can do anything a human being can do.
It's literally like having your own
employee. I think I'm prepared to say,
and this is not hyperbolic. This is the
best technology I've ever used in my
life and by far the best application of
AI I've ever seen. This is what they
wanted Claude Co-work to be. In this
video, I'll show you how it works, how
to set it up for yourself, and show you
six things I've been doing over the last
48 hours of Claudebot that have changed
my life. I'll also towards the end of
the video go over why I'm actually kind
of scared of what's going to happen when
the entire world starts using this tech.
If you stick with me until the end of
this video, you'll have a full-time 24/7
AI employee working for you. Let's get
into it. So, what you see on my screen
right here is Claudebot. This is a local
gateway running on my Mac Mini that I
have right here on my desk that has this
AI agent working for me 24/7. Best part
about this is it's an open- source
project, so it's not owned by any big
company that can spy on you or do
anything. It was all created by Peter
Steinberger, who's a successful
entrepreneur who's now dedicated to this
project. He is a great man for putting
this out and giving this to the world
because this has absolutely changed my
life and changed the life of a lot of
people I've talked to. So, shout out
Peter Steinberg. Make sure to follow him
on X. So, this is running on my Mac Mini
and can control the entire computer. It
can pop open browsers. It can do work in
Google Docs. It can look at your Apple
Notes. It can write notion documents.
Anything you can do on your computer, it
can look at your email, it can send
emails, it can respond to emails.
Literally anything you can do on your
computer, this Clawbot can do. The three
parts about this I think are absolutely
mind-blowing is one, what I just talked
about, the fact that it can control
everything on your computer. There are
absolutely no guard rails on this
whatsoever. It's completely unhinged.
But number two, it has infinite memory.
So it has a really complex memory system
where everything I say, everything I do
is constantly saved to memory. after
every chat session with it, they take
what we talk about and all the important
tidbits about me and save it to our
memories. So, for instance, in one of
our first conversations, I mentioned I
have a newsletter. 2 days later, it
proactively wrote me a few drafts for my
newsletter cuz I mentioned I send out
newsletters on a specific day. It
proactively did that work for me. That
is hours saved a week just like that
because of Cloudbot. The third part that
blows my mind and that makes this
amazing is the fact that this is
completely interfaced through messaging
services. I name my Claudebot Henry and
I gave it a little owl logo. It just
makes it a lot more fun to interact with
when it has a name. So when I say Henry
for the rest of this video, you know I'm
talking about my Claudebot. I completely
engage with Henry through Telegram, but
you can also do iMessage. You can also
do WhatsApp. There's like 20 different
messaging apps you can use. If you want
to do Discord, you can do Discord. And
what makes this so great is now from
anywhere in the world, I can just open
up my messaging app and say, "Henry,
please do this on my computer. Please
write this document. Please respond to
this email. Please go on Amazon and buy
this for me." Literally anything I can
do on a computer, I can text Henry from
anywhere in the world and Henry will go
and do that for me. Just as a quick
example, I said, "Henry, I want to track
all your tasks that you work on in a
canban board, like a project management
board." And I texted him that while I
was at Chick-fil-A, and he text me back
a few options. I go, "Okay, this looks
great. Build the canban board." I come
back to my computer. Henry vibecoded an
entire cananband board with Claude code
for me. I'm not even using Claude code
anymore. Henry does all the Claude
coding for me. Henry can control Claude
code, Codeex, any Vibe coding platform
you can think of. Henry just pops open,
builds it. Now I have an agent doing my
coding for me. I don't even do the
coding myself. And just if you're
curious what that project management
platform looks like that Henry built.
Here it is. I think this looks amazing.
It looks like linear. All the tasks
Henry complete goes over here in
activity and I can just create a backlog
for Henry and I just assign it to him
and he just starts working on it and I
can track his tasks across the board. He
just built this by himself. I mean, I
can't stress this enough. This is
literally like a human employee. A
couple more examples I'll show you just
to get you excited before I show you how
to set it up. This morning, he just
started proactively sending me a morning
brief. So, check this out. Based on our
conversations over the last couple days,
he's like, "Okay, I'm going to send you
a morning brief just with things that
you might care about." So, he found
other AI channels on YouTube and showed
me what videos they've been posting
lately. Showed me the weather where I'm
at in Mountain View. Showed me trending
news on AI because all we do is talk
about AI. And then even gave me a
breakdown of all the overnight work
Henry did for me. So, he wrote me a
YouTube script for this video. I'm using
the script Henry wrote for me in this
video, gave me another script for Ralph
Wigum, and wrote another newsletter
draft for me on the changing AI
landscape. And then he gave me, cuz he
knows I'm a content creator, a few ideas
of things I can do for today based on
what's happening in the world of AI.
Have a great Saturday. I love the little
human touches. This was all proactively
done. This is direct value in my life
just like that. And I didn't need to
think of this. I didn't need to set all
this up. Henry just learns about me and
starts doing work for me. This I really
believe is going to change so many
lives. I now truly see the path to
building a oneperson billiondoll
business. I think it's possible. I think
I can do it and I think it's possible
because of Claudebot. You need to be
setting this up. You need to be working
with it. So, how do you set it up? Let's
get into that right now. So, the first
question I get all the time over the
last two days has always been, "Do I
really need a Mac Mini? Do I need to buy
a Mac Mini and run out and get it?" The
answer to that is no. You do not need a
Mac Mini. You can do this significantly
cheaper than a $600 Mac Mini. I
personally bought a Mac Mini for this
for a few different reasons. One, I
really like Mac OS. I love the operating
system. I think it's very easy for me to
just go in, see what Henry's working on
and send out any work I need or help out
Henry with anything he's doing. I just
love the Mac operating system. Two, all
my other devices are Apple devices, so I
can very quickly go on my iPad, go on my
MacBook Pro, go on my iPhone, take any
files from my devices and airdrop it to
Henry. For instance, the thumbnail to
this video, I took one of my template
thumbnails that was on my phone. I air
dropped it to Henry and I texted him on
Telegram, "Hey, take this and edit it
and make it good for Claudebot." Also,
side note, Henry has access to any AI
service you can think of. So, it used
Nano Banana Pro to edit the thumbnail,
the one you see here. And lastly, the
third reason I bought a Mac Mini is it's
just fun. It's just fun having a device
on your desk that you look at and you
see an AI agent working on 24/7.
Sometimes you do not need a reason to do
things. Sometimes a good reason to do
things is you just want to have a little
fun. And for me, seeing a Mac Mini on my
desk, knowing there's an AI agent
working on it 24/7, that is fun to me
and that is worth it. And I know for a
fact this AI is going to have an ROI
significantly higher than $600. In fact,
I'm very confident this AI will have a
ROI well over a million dollar. So, I am
fine buying a Mac Mini just to make it a
tad more convenient. And you really
don't need an expensive Mac Mini for
this. You can literally buy the cheapest
one. That's the one I bought. I just
went with the base $600 version. It
doesn't require a ton of storage or
memory. The only reason you'd want more
storage in memory though is a few
reasons. If one you plan on having Henry
do very storage or memory intensive
things. So for instance, if I figure out
a way to have Henry start doing video
editing for me, I'm going to be dropping
a ton of videos onto this Mac Mini. And
so I might end up having to expand to a
larger one. I'll probably just buy an
external SSD. But also another thing is
Henry is a really good vibe coder. And
if I'm gonna have Henry vibe code five
or six apps at the same time, I'm
probably going to want more memory than
this. So, this is just me testing it
out, seeing if I can maximize this
hardware. But if I need more hardware, I
might buy a more expensive Mac. But
that's only if you're doing a Mac Mini.
There are way cheaper and easier ways to
get Cloudbot set up. Like right now, you
don't need to run out to a Mac store.
All you need to run Claudebot is a VPS,
so your own virtual private server.
There are a lot of really cheap ways to
do that. One of them is AWS. You can go
on AWS and spin up like a free plan
right now and run it yourself. The
reason why I would recommend not doing
Clawbot on your main computer is it is
an AI with zero guardrails that can do
anything on your computer at all. So
that's why it's a good reason to put it
in its own environment. If you install
this right now on your main computer and
you give it a prompt and you don't know
really know what you're doing, it could
start doing things with your personal
files that you don't want. Say you tell
it to send an email and it gets confused
and it goes to your personal email
service and sends off some emails from
your own name you don't want. Or say it
gets confused and opens up your iMessage
and starts sending messages through your
text to your friends, right? You don't
want to do that. And I'm not saying this
is like a really stupid AI. It's it's
super smart. But as you get up and
running, as you learn how it works, you
really want it in its own environment.
So, if you are hesitant or you don't
want to spend a ton of money, this is
honestly probably the smart way to do it
to sign up for a VPS, get your own
virtual private server, install
Claudebot on it, and have it in its own
separate instance. And then from there,
a lot of things I did was I gave it its
own email address. So, I signed up on
Gmail for its own email account. I gave
it its own accounts for everything. So,
it doesn't use my own personal accounts
because again, there are zero guardrails
on this. So, you want to be safe as
well. One thing we didn't cover is using
a super expensive computer instead of a
Mac Mini or a VPS. There is actually use
cases behind that as well. So, if you
really wanted to go nuts, and this might
honestly be something I do, you could
buy a really good computer like a Mac
Studio and then max out its memory, like
go 512 and spend like 10K on this. And
the reason why you might want to do this
is you can then run local models on this
computer. So Claudebot is completely
free, completely open source, but it
needs to be powered by an AI service.
You can use any AI service you want. I'm
going to go in detail on that in a
second once we go to the actual setup
past this hardware. But if you really
wanted to, you could run your own local
model on your computer that powers
Claudebot. So there are actually
realistic use cases why you might want a
super powerful computer to use this if
you want the privacy of having all your
data local on your computer. And if you
want unlimited basically free usage if
you don't count like power and energy of
Claudebot as well. But while Claudebot
is free again you're going to need an AI
service to power it. Claudebot's kind of
the framework of this AI agent that
controls it and makes it work 24/7. The
brain is going to be your AI service
which you can use your existing Claude
service if you want. So my $200 Claude
Max plan that's what powers it. So I'm
not spending any extra money on the AI.
If you want to use your chat GPT
subscription, you can do that. If you
want to use APIs, you can do that. And
I'll go in more in details in the
different options shortly when we get
into setup. Okay, so you decided how you
want to run Cloudbot. You have either a
Mac Mini or a different computer. Maybe
you have a second computer laying around
your house that you want to use, or
maybe you set up a virtual private
server. It doesn't matter. Or maybe
you're even crazy and you set it up on
your home computer. That's fine as well.
How do you set it up from here? Well,
very, very simple. It is one line right
here. If you go to claude.bot,
cl a w.bot. You scroll down here. You
have the quick start. You hit copy right
there. Very, very simple. This is the
most powerful tech. And it's all done
with one line. You open up a new window.
You open up a new terminal window. You
paste it in. You hit enter. And that
installs Claudebot. What that's going to
do is take you through an entire
onboarding session. This is what you're
going to see. You're going to see this
onboarding right here. You're going to
want to hit yes on I understand this is
very powerful and very risky. And then
it's going to take you through this
onboarding session. You're going to be
able to choose your you're going to be
able to choose your model and off
provider. So you have so many different
options here. I used Anthropic. I'm
using my Claude Max account. You can use
your existing subscriptions if you want.
So what we're going to do now real quick
is go through the advantages and
disadvantages of each of these models.
You can do this for really cheap or
really expensive. You have many
different options here. The most
expensive way is through the claw API.
This will you can spend thousands
thousands thousands of dollars a month
on the Claude API if you want. The next
most expensive way is Claude Max for
$200 a month. This gives you a lot of
opus usage. The best model you can use
with Claudebot is Claude Opus. The way I
like to think about the decision around
which model you should be using is
personality and intelligence. You want a
lot of intelligence and you want as much
personality as possible. Out of all the
models you can choose, which I just
showed you on that list, the absolute
best one that's highest intelligence,
highest personality is Claude Opus 45.
It is maximally smart. It does
everything I tell it to do. It never
gets confused. And also, it has by far
the best personality. And don't
underestimate the personality factor
here. I'm serious. And I'm not usually
one of these types of guys that like
care about the personality of the AI,
but talking to Henry, my Clawbot, and it
talking back and feeling human makes
this so much more fun and satisfying.
You really want a good personality. When
I was testing out the other models and
they didn't feel very human, it made the
entire experience a lot less fun. When
you would text Henry to do something and
he would text back like some robotic
response that felt like AI, it took away
this illusion that you were talking to
your employee. So personality actually
matters a lot. So Opus 45, highest
personality, highest intelligence. Then
after that you have Chad GPT 5.2 that is
very intelligent, but its personality
isn't great to be quite honest with you.
So Chad GPT 5.2 or whatever the latest
model is for you at the time of this
video. It's very intelligent, but its
personality feels very robotic. I don't
love the way it talks to me. Then you
have a lot of these other models. And
honestly, I'd group most of them
together. But Mini Max, I'd say if like
you want to save money, is probably the
best option to go with. It's going to be
pretty intelligent and the personality
is actually going to be pretty good. And
so I'd go Miniax here. And you could, if
you go with Miniax, spend like literally
$10 a month on this, right? If you go
with Chad GBT, you're going to spend
probably like $100 a month. If you do
Claude Opus, you're going to spend $200
a month on the Max plan. If you do
Miniax, you can spend $10 a month. Get
all the usage you would out of these
two. The downside again is the
personality is not great. Honestly, I
might do this just to show you the
difference in personalities here. Like
Opus is on just another level. It truly
feels human to talk to. So, if you want
the maximum experience, I'd recommend
going with the Clawed subscription.
Otherwise, if you like you want to save
money, I'd go with Miniax. If you're
already using Chat GPT and you already
got a subscription, especially a pro
one, you can just use your Chat GBT
subscription. No problem at all. Just
know you're not getting the same
personality experience. So, you go
through that. The next thing it's going
to have you set up is the different
skills. What's really amazing about
Claudebot is it is completely extensible
and customizable. And what that means is
you can add any functionality you want
to Claudebot. It has full use of skills
and it has a full marketplace of skills
as well. It has skills to control your
Apple notes. It has skills to control
your notion. It has skills to pop open
claude code and vibe code for you. It
has skills to make powerpoints for you.
It has skills to manage your to-do list.
I have it right now managing my things
three to-do list. And so like I can go
in, I can text Henry on Telegram and
it'll tell me all everything on my to-do
list for that day. And then I do cool
things like say, "Okay, choose one of
the to-do list items and help me out
with it and do something for me." And
it'll go choose one of the items and
help it out. It really is incredible.
So, the next screen you're going to go
on here, I'm not going to do this
overand because I don't want to reset
all my settings, is the skills. Just
choose whatever apps in the skills list
you want to use. And the last screen
it'll go through is the messaging setup.
And this is super easy. You have many
different options. Telegram, WhatsApp,
iMessage, anything you want. Telegram
was super easy for me. I chose Telegram
just cuz I think the app's nice. I also
don't message anyone else on Telegram. I
barely use that app. So, I have an app
service just for Henry that I use on
Telegram, but you can use iMessage,
WhatsApp, anything you want. They all
work really, really well and it is super
responsive and the setup is extremely
easy. So, you just choose your messaging
service and you're good to go. So,
you're all set up and then honestly took
only like 5 minutes to do. Now is the
part that is going to consume your
entire life. This is the part you're now
going to be going sleepless for the next
week of setting up and customizing and
that is actually using Claudebot
personalizing getting it to know you.
You honestly the mindset you want to
have is treating this like a human
being. Seriously like so say you hire
someone at your business. Say you got a
business you hire an employee. What's
the first thing you do? You probably
take them out to lunch and get to know
them, right? You probably understand
what they're into. They get to know you.
They understand how you want them to
work. So, the first thing I would do
once you have Claudebot set up is I
would go into this chat. Again, this is
the gateway that's going to
automatically open once you're all set
up. This is the main thing. If you want
to do this from Telegram or iMessage,
you can do that as well on your
computer. I'd go in and I'd say I'd say,
"Hi, Claudebot. Let's get to know each
other and get a good working
relationship going. I'm going to tell
you about myself. Then, please ask me
any questions you want." Then I'd hit
shift enter. Shift enter. And then I
would just brain dump literally
everything about you. all your
interests, what you're into, what your
job is, the work you do on a day-to-day
basis, the work you do on a weekly
basis. As much information about
yourself as humanly possible, what tools
you use, who your favorite sports teams
are, why you think Drake May is the best
quarterback in the NFL, anything you
want, you can dump into there. What
that's going to do is create a memory
for Claudebot or whatever you name your
own personal assistant, mine being
Henry. And all that we memorized so that
once Claudebot goes and starts doing
work for you, it has a full pool of
memory to pull from to make sure it's
doing relevant work. Next, I'd have it
set up a daily brief. So, this daily
brief it sends me is super super helpful
and it's something it came up with to do
for me, but yours might not do that. So,
I'd say, "Hey, set up a morning brief."
One thing I'd make sure you include in
that morning brief though is ideas for
today. What I'd recommend you ask it to
do for the ideas for today is say, "Come
up with ideas for things you can do for
me. Come up based on what you know about
me, come up with ideas for tasks you can
do." This is the super powerful part
about Claudebot is it can literally do
anything. And us as humans, we're not
able to creatively think that much to
come up with all these tasks. So, you
want to lean on Claudebot as much as you
can. As much as you can go and say,
"Hey, what can you do for me here based
on what you know about me? What can you
do? What do you think would be helpful
to do right now? Do that as much as you
can and it will come up with so many
tasks that you can't even imagine. The
next thing you want to have Claudebot do
is vibe code for you. It is actually an
amazing vibe coder. It can control any
vibe coding service you use. So the best
ones to use are through the CLI. So if
you have Claude code or if you have
Codeex, make sure to get that installed
on your new computer and have your
Claudebot use it. So you can say, "Hey,
I'm using codec. make sure you use it
are cla code and then give it ideas for
things to build. So I told it to build
this canband board. It wrote all the
code for me through claude code. It
uploaded it to GitHub. It created a pull
request. It sent me a link for the pull
request and I was able to review it when
I got home. This is a really amazing
workflow. So if you have apps already on
GitHub, just say, "Henry, I logged into
GitHub on your computer. Go check it
out. Go see what repos I have. Review
them. And then build any functionality
you think will be helpful. Go tackle
this repository and see if there are any
bugs. go tackle this repository and
clean up the code. Go look at this
repository and build this feature out
for me. So, my app creator buddy, I came
up with an idea the other day for an
article building feature cuz articles
are like blowing up right now on
Twitter. And I told Henry to build out
this article writing feature and it
built this out for me. I was on the
road. I was in my car in full
self-driving mode. I'm literally living
in the future. And I texted Henry, hey,
can you build out some sort of
functionality in Creator Buddy where it
can write articles? And it went, it
built this out. It created the pull
request. I reviewed it and committed it.
Boom. Just like that. So, you should be
vibe coding with your Clawbot as well.
Give it access to your repositories.
Give it ideas for things to build or
just say, "Hey, look at my
functionality. Do research." This is
this is literally a workflow you can do.
Say, "Hey, go on Twitter. Review what
people in the AI community are saying.
Whatever you're interested in, review
what people in the sports community are
saying. Find their challenges, then
build out apps for them that would be
helpful and they would want to buy. Your
Clawbot will open up the window, go on
Twitter, scroll Twitter, find challenges
people have, and then vibe code you an
entire app. You can do really advanced
workflows like that. The way you want to
think about this is anything a human
being can do, your Claudebot can do.
Anything. Anything. If you want to go
right now and scroll on X, find tweets,
build stuff off that, write documents
off that, write an article off that,
some 20step crazy workflow. If a human
being can do it, your Claudebot can do
it. And you want to experiment and do
those things. I'd also have your
Claudebot build out this project
management tool. So, go to your
Claudebot, type in there, hey, I want to
build out a project management tool, a
cananban board, so I can monitor
everything you're doing, track your
tasks, give you tasks easily. uh and hit
enter on that and have it build out a
mission control like this. And this just
makes it very easy for me to track all
the tasks Henry are doing for me. If I
come up with like 20 different tasks, I
don't have to sit there and text Henry
for an hour. I can go in and add a bunch
of tasks to the backlog and then I can
assign it to Henry and then Henry will
see it and then go start working on the
task. This is really, really nice. This
made it a lot easier to work with Henry.
So, make sure you go and set up a
canband board like this. All you need to
do is go to your club and say, "Hey,
build out a cananband board through
Claude Code or Codeex or whatever that
tracks our tasks and it will go and do
it for you." Something else really cool
it can do I'd recommend doing is create
a Gmail account for your Claudebot. I
went in, I went on my Mac Mini, I set up
a brand new Gmail account for Claudebot.
And now when I get emails, I could
forward them to Henry and say, "Henry,
respond to this. Henry, do this."
Whatever I want Henry to do, Henry can
do it. Make sure you set up an email
account for your Claudebot. It'll unlock
so many functional. I mean, you just
treat it like it's your assistant. So,
if you get an email, you can forward it
to your Clawbot or CC them and say,
"Hey, do this for me. Schedule an event.
Respond to this. Remind me about this
email at some other point." Or, "Hey, do
the tasks mentioned in this email for
me." And your Clawbot will go and do
them. So, another thing I set up that I
really recommend you doing, set up an
email service, Gmail, for your Clawbot.
And the last thing I would set up is a
second brain for your Claudebot. And so
I went into Henry, I said, "Hey, I want
to build out a second brain. I want an
organization system where if I just text
you ideas for videos, tweets, just
thoughts about the world. I want to just
be able to text it to you, you take that
information and you organize it into
different folders in our second brain."
And Henry set up this file system for
me. And now whenever I text Henry, if I
text him a tweet idea, he'll put it in
ideas. If I text him an idea for an app,
he'll put it in the inbox. If I text him
something I want to get researched,
he'll put it in research. And now we
have an entire second brain system built
out. He's now right now as we speak
working on the UI for this so I can
quickly view all our ideas that we
collected together. And my plan is for
this to completely replace notion for me
so I don't have to pay for notion
anymore. Set up a second brain as well.
And this could be totally personalized
to you. So say Claudebot, let's set up a
second brain based on what you know
about me. What would be the best way to
set this up? And your Claudebot will go
and do it. Again, the mindset you need
to have is this is an AI employee. It
can do anything for you. It can work
247. Before I go to bed, every single
night, I literally open up Telegram and
I text Henry, "Hey, build something cool
for me tonight." And it'll go and vibe
code all night and build something
really neat. And every morning I wake up
to a brand new app. It really is
amazing. That's the way you want to
treat this. As someone who works for
you, who never sleeps, never has to eat,
and is able to work for you at any time.
That's the way you want to treat this.
And if you treat this like that, you can
unlock productivity you never thought
was possible. So, I want to get real
with you. I want to tell you about why
this actually makes me really, really
scared. So, one, I'm not being
hyperbolic here. I truly mean this. This
is the most amazing technology I've ever
used. I truly feel like I have employees
working for me, and I truly, for the
first time in my life, see the path to a
oneperson billion-dollar business. I do
not need employees anymore. This is my
employee. This is better than human
employees. It can work 24/7. I am a
soloreneur with zero employees and I
feel like I'm capable of competing with
anybody there is. But why does this make
me so nervous? I think people are in
danger. I really mean that. I thought
this was 101 15 years away. This is
available now. This can easily start
replacing people now. I think a big
portion of the global workforce has been
completely eliminated by this. And when
people start getting their hands on
this, when businesses start getting
their hands on this, when you start
getting your hands on this, it's going
to change things. I tr this came out
like 3 weeks ago. I think 99.9% of
people have no idea this exists. I think
99.9% of people never thought something
like this would exist in their lifetime.
And it is available now. And when
managers, when companies, when anyone
starts getting their hands on this, I
think they're going to start questioning
why do we have a parallegal? Why do we
have a lawyer? Why do we have junior
level roles? Why do I have an executive
assistant? Why do I have a secretary? I
think this is actually going to have a
monstrous impact on the world and we
really aren't prepared for it. I don't
think we have the systems in place. I
don't think we have the help in place. I
think this is going to hit the world
like a hurricane and no one is prepared
for it. And that makes me really
nervous. But that's the thing about
innovation and it's been this way since
day one, since the world started. You
cannot stop innovation. It is the most
unstoppable force in the entire world.
When the industrial revolution happened
and jobs were being eliminated and
people were getting pissed off at
machines, they tried breaking them. They
charged them with hammers. They tried
stopping companies from using machines.
It didn't matter. You cannot stop
innovation no matter how much you try.
So there are two ways to look at this.
You can try to stop it. You can say this
is bad for humanity. You can say hey we
can't do this. You're going to lose.
There's no way to stop it. So the only
other way to handle this is to embrace
it, to use it, to get the benefits out
of it, to improve your life with it.
Will there be disruption? Yes, we are
not prepared for this. This is the
fastest moving technology of all time
and we are not prepared for it. We will
go through a period of turmoil. We will
go through a period of disruption, but
we have no options. So you can either
roll over and die or you can embrace it,
be on the cutting edge, and use it. And
I think you should be on the cutting
edge. And that's why you tune in to this
YouTube channel to be on the cutting
edge to learn about the newest
technology to see how to use it. That's
why I highly recommend subscribing and
turning on notifications below so that
you can get alerted on this tech the
moment it drops. I highly recommend
leaving a like down below. That helps
out the channel a lot so I can keep
pumping out videos like this that keep
you up todate on the latest technology.
I cannot highly recommend enough. Take
action today. As of filming, this is a
Saturday. If you're watching this on a
Saturday, go out, do what you need,
install Claudebot, start using it, use
the latest technology today. You do not
want to be left behind on things like
this because this is as cutting edge as
it gets. You want to be on the cutting
edge. I hope this was helpful. I'll see
you in the next video.
