Claudebot is going viral at the moment.
If you haven't come across it yet, it's
open source software that lets you run
your own AI assistant on a server. You
can message it through apps like
WhatsApp, Telegram, or Slack. It runs
around the clock. You can give it access
to your file system, shell, browser,
calendar, and email. So, it can act
autonomously on your behalf, whether
you're watching or not. A lot of
creators are hyping it right now and
showing off the impressive things it can
do. But I wanted to make a quick video
to talk through what you need to do
before you start using it. And that's
understanding the risks and putting
security guard rails in place. Burack
Eragar put it bluntly in this thread on
X. Most people will install Claudebot
and accidentally hand it their entire
life. If you run this with default
settings, you're one prompt injection
away from wiping your entire GitHub
organization, losing your emails, or
much worse. This thread has had over
400,000 views, and Peter Steinberger,
the creator of Claudebot, reposted it.
So, there are things you need to do from
a security and guardrail perspective to
protect yourself before you start using
it. And this video consolidates those
recommendations into five steps you can
run through in about 10 minutes. Before
we get into the five steps, it's worth
understanding what you're actually
installing. Claudebot is fundamentally
different from using something like
Claude or Chat GPT in a browser or
running Claude code or Codeex in your
terminal. With browserbased chat, you're
in the provider's environment. It
doesn't have direct access to your local
machine or server. With CLI agents like
Claude Code or Codeex, they can access
your file system and execute commands,
but only while you're actively using
them in a terminal session. You're
present and you're watching what they
do. Claudebot is different. It's a 24/7
agent running on your server that can
execute shell commands, read and write
files, control a browser, and send
messages on your behalf, all while
you're asleep or away from your desk. It
has persistent memory of everything you
tell it, and anyone who can message it
can potentially trigger those
capabilities. That combination is what
makes it risky. If someone sends your
bot a malicious message or even a
message containing hidden instructions
in a link or document, they could
potentially manipulate it into running
commands, excfiltrating data, or taking
actions you never intended. That's what
prompt injection is. And with Claudebot,
the blast radius is your entire server
and every service is connected to. So
that's why these security measures and
guardrails are so important. And as
mentioned, the creator of Claudebot,
Peter Steinberger, published a list of
guardrails that you should have in
place. So, in this video, we'll walk
through each one of them, starting with
how to enable sandbox mode. Before we
get into security steps, a quick note on
setup. A lot of people are buying Mac
minis to run Claudebot, but you don't
need to do that. Peter Sinberger himself
says you can deploy this on Amazon's
free tier. If you want a step-by-step
tutorial on how to set it up via AWS,
let me know in the comments and I'll
work on a separate video for that. Once
you've installed Claudebot and completed
the onboarding process, you'll see this
screen. Then you want to press Ctrl C to
exit and run this command. This will
open up the Claudebot.json configuration
file. This controls everything from
which model you're using to how the
agents behave. This acts as the main
configuration file for Claudebot. You
can see by default we have some basic
settings already. Messages controls how
the bot acknowledges messages in groups.
Agents defines things like how many
concurrent sessions can run and which
model you're using. In this case, we're
using Opus 4.5. The workspace is the
directory where Claudebot stores its
working files. And gateway controls how
the server runs and authenticates. What
you'll notice is there's no sandbox
configuration here by default, which
means right now any commands the agent
runs are executing directly on your
server with full access. So, we're going
to add a sandbox block to change that.
As you can see, I've now added the
sandbox configuration inside the agents
default section. Let me walk you through
what each setting does. First, we've got
mode set to all. This means every
session runs inside a Docker container
instead of directly on your server. You
can also set this to non-main if you
want your personal DM chat to run
unsandboxed, but have group chats and
other sessions isolated, but all is the
safest option. Next, we've got scope set
to session. This means each conversation
gets its own isolated container. So if
you're chatting with it via Telegram and
someone else messages it via WhatsApp,
those are two separate sandboxed
environments. You could also set this to
agent for one container per agent or
shared for a single container across
everything. But session gives you the
strongest isolation. One thing to note,
sandboxing requires Docker to be
installed on your server. If you don't
have Docker set up yet, you'll need to
install it and run the sandbox setup
script from the Claudebot repo. I'll
link the docs to that in the
description. And then we've got
workspace access set to none. This means
the sandbox tools can't access your
agents workspace directory at all. You
can set this to RORO for readonly access
or RW for read write, but none is the
most restrictive. The key thing to
understand is that sandboxing isn't
bulletproof. It won't stop every
possible attack, but it significantly
reduces the blast radius if the model
does something unexpected or gets
manipulated by a malicious prompt. Once
we're happy with that, we can exit from
this and then we can run the command
claudebot gateway restart so the changes
take effect. So, we've covered sandbox
mode, but Peter also mentions
whitelisting commands if you plan to run
them out of the sandbox. This is about
tool policies, controlling what the
agent can actually do, not just where it
runs. By default, Claudebot gives the
agent access to a broad set of tools.
File reading, writing, shell execution,
browser control, and more. You can
restrict this in your config by
specifying an allow list and a deny list
for tools. For example, you might allow
the agent to read files and search the
web, but explicitly block shell
execution and browser control. The key
distinction is this. Sandbox mode limits
the blast radius if something goes
wrong, while tool policies limit what
can happen in the first place. Combining
both gives you layered protection. I
won't walk through the config for this
one, but the docs have examples under
the multi- aent sandbox and tools
section. I'll link that in the
description as well. But we can see next
in Peter's post, he says read the
security doc. So what I will show you
next is the built-in security audit
which checks your entire configuration
for common issues. And just quickly, we
can see the security docs here which
again I will link in the description
below. These are the three key commands
you want to run as a security audit. So,
we'll jump over to the terminal and run
those now. So, we're back in the
terminal. The first command I ran was
Claudebot security audit. You can see it
found a critical issue right away. My
credentials directory has permissions
that are too open, meaning another user
on the system could potentially access
or modify credential files. It also
flags a warning about reverse proxy
configuration and gives me an info
summary of my attack surface, showing
things like how many groups are open
versus allow listed, whether elevated
tools are enabled, and whether browser
control is exposed. You can also run
Claudebot security audit with a deep
flag which does additional live probes
of your gateway to check for network
exposure. Useful if you've opened up any
external access. But the most useful
flag is d-fix which automatically
applies safe corrections. And we can now
see the output from that command on
screen. You can see it's fixed the
permissions on my credentials directory
and the sessions directory changing them
to 700 so only my user can access them.
The critical issue is now gone. The
warning about trusted proxies is still
there, but that's fine for a local
setup. It's only relevant if you're
exposing the control UI through a
reverse proxy. The docs recommend
running this regularly, especially after
changing your config or exposing any
network surfaces. It's a quick sanity
check to make sure you haven't
accidentally left something open. So,
we've locked down the agent itself with
sandboxing and verified our config with
a security audit. The next step is about
the external services you connect to
Claudebot. Things like GitHub, Google
Calendar, Gmail, and other APIs. When
you connect these services, you need to
give Claudebot access tokens. And the
temptation is to just grant full access
so everything works. But that's exactly
what you don't want to do. The principle
here is minimum permissions. Every
integration should have only the access
it actually needs and nothing more. For
example, with GitHub, don't give it a
full repo scope, which grants complete
control over all your repositories.
Instead, use public repo if you only
need it to work with public repos or
scope it to specific repos. With Google,
don't give it full account access. If
you only need calendar functionality,
give it read only calendar access. If
you only need to read emails, don't give
it permission to send. Burak calls this
out specifically in his post. He says
99% of people will mess this up. And the
reason it matters is simple. If the
agent gets manipulated through a prompt
injection or does something unexpected,
it can only do what the token allows. A
readonly token, for example, can't
delete your repos. A calendar only token
can't send emails on your behalf. So
before you connect any service, ask
yourself what's the minimum access that
is actually needed here and don't allow
any more than that. So just as an
example in GitHub, you go to developer
settings, personal access tokens, and
select fine grain tokens. This is where
you create access tokens for Claudebot.
You can see I've selected public repos
only which gives readonly access by
default. And there's a whole list of
additional permissions here. Things like
email addresses, SSH keys, profile
access, but I'm not adding any of those.
The principle here is minimum
permissions only. So I can generate this
token with just read only access to
public repos. And even if the agent gets
manipulated, the worst it can do is read
public code. It can't push changes,
access private repos, or touch anything
else in my account. So, you've sandboxed
the agent, run the security audit, and
scoped your tokens. The last step is
about who can actually talk to your bot.
Burack in his post says this, "Never add
your personal Claudebot to a WhatsApp or
Telegram group chat. Every person in
that chat effectively has shell access
to your server via the bot." He says to
treat this agent like a pseudo terminal
because that's essentially what it is.
And Peter echoes the same thing in his
guard rails list. Don't add it to group
chats if it's your personal bot. The
reason is simple. If someone can message
your bot, they can potentially
manipulate it. Whether that's a
malicious link, a document with hidden
instructions, or just a cleverly worded
prompt. The more people who have access,
the larger your attack surface. If you
do need the bot in a group setting, make
sure you're using sandbox mode, tool
restrictions, and set your group policy
to allow list so only approved users can
interact with it. But for a personal
assistant, keep it to just you or a
small number of people you actually
trust. One more thing worth mentioning
from the official readme doc. Peter
says, "While any model is supported, I
strongly recommend Anthropic Pro Max
plan with Opus 4.5 for long context
strength and better prompt injection
resistance. The logic here is that more
capable models are better at recognizing
when they're being manipulated. A
cheaper model might follow malicious
instructions embedded in a document or
link without questioning them. A more
capable model is more likely to catch
it. So if you're running an agent with
real access to your systems, this
probably isn't the place to cut costs on
API tokens. And that's the model that
Peter recommends. So to recap, here are
the five steps. Number one, enable
sandbox mode. Run the Asian inside a
Docker container instead of directly on
your server. This limits the blast
radius if something goes wrong. Number
two, consider tool restrictions. Decide
what the agent actually needs to do and
disable tools it doesn't need like shell
execution or browser control. Number
three, run the security audit. Use the
command claudebot security audit to
check your config for common issues and
the d-fix flag to automatically tighten
permissions. Number four, scope your
tokens when connecting external
services. Give minimum permissions only.
Read only where possible and limited to
specific resources rather than full
account access. And number five, keep it
private. Don't add your personal bot to
group chats. Treat it like a pseudo
terminal. Only people you trust should
have access. This checklist is based on
the creator of Claudebot, Peter
Steinberger's Guard Rails list, and also
Burak Era's thread. Both are linked in
the description if you want to read them
in full. They're not complicated steps
and they only take a few minutes, but
they are extremely important. Security
and guardrails are a key step,
especially if you're using software like
Claudebot. So, I highly recommend
implementing these steps before you get
started. If you want to see a full setup

Claudebot, let me know in the comments.
