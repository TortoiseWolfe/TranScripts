So, seeing as I don't think I've had
enough lobster tail over the last few
days, earlier this morning, I decided to
check in on the train wreck that was
Claudebot. And what I found just about
molted me right out of my skin. It's
bad, folks. We have people being
permanently banned from Claude, others
building their own Claudebot skills on
Claude Hub, getting root access to
people's control panel. And in general,
probably somewhere between a few hundred
and maybe a few thousand Claudebot
instances have now been hacked. For
those of you uninitiated, this is
basically the red wedding of vibe coding
happening in real time. So, check this
out. In order to run Claudebot on a VPS,
which is the way that most people that
are shelling out Mac minis left and
right are doing, you need to basically
post it to a publicly available URL.
Well, turns out there are services out
there like Shodan and others that are
constantly scraping every available URL
on the internet. They're indexing them
and then they're adding them to a
database. Now, when you sign up to
Claudebot, it gives you a Claude control
panel, which basically allows you to
talk to Claudebot in this interface
here, get an overview, see all the
channels, instances, sessions, cron
jobs, and more. And some people
customize the hell out of this thing.
Well, the wild part is if you search one
of these publicly available index
databases for a snippet of text that
appears on every one of these Clawbot
control pages, which is just the words
Clawbot and then control, you get a list
of thousands of servers that are
currently running that you can access by
literally just clicking a button. So,
this is somebody's page right here. And
I picked a safe one because as you see
here, it says disconnected device
identity required. It doesn't actually
allow me to chat with it. Also, I did
this because I don't want to get sued
for having somebody's API credentials.
But it turns out, as this really smart
guy Jameson over here found out, if
these servers use a tool called Nginx
as a reverse proxy, then due to a quirk
in the way that Nginx works and
interfaces with Claudebot, you'll get
full access to anybody's Cloudbot
control page, which means not only are
you going to be able to fully read all
the messages sent to and from this
person, you'll also get access to all of
their skills, all of the config
information, and all of their API keys.
For anybody who knows me, I'm not
exactly the most secure individual on
Earth. I'm probably as loose with my API
keys as Jeffrey Epstein was with his
freaking letters. But the reason this is
such a big deal is because the way that
most people are using Claudebot is
they'll upload all of their API keys,
all of their tokens, and all of their
secrets to all of their messaging
platforms and various services like
Anthropic and so on and so forth. And
with that, you have access to somebody's
whole entire life. This fella here,
Jameson, is what we'd consider a white
hat hacker. And what he did, because
he's good, is he went through, found
somebody's information here, a supposed
AI systems engineer, and actually fully
identified them as well as got all of
their message history. I'm certainly
hoping he didn't do anything with that
information, because Lord knows what
people would do with my damn messaging
history. But this is just one of
potentially several hundred examples of
Claudebot vulnerabilities that are
occurring right now. We have hundreds of
security experts bemoaning just how bad
of a situation the Claudebot story
really is. And we also obviously have
the situations where somebody gives
Claudebot root access and it goes
absolutely nuts. So why am I making this
video? Is it just to dump all over the
progress of somebody that has genuinely
put a lot of hard work and effort into
making a product that other people can
use? No, of course not. But suffice to
say, we are currently not winning, son.
So what I'd like to do is show you guys
a bunch of ways you can win. If you're
going to use this absolute cluster
of a product, we might as well do so
safely. So, public service announcement.
If you're setting this puppy up on a
VPS, the first thing you need to do is
you need to lock down your
infrastructure. What's the biggest issue
with infrastructure right now? Well, I
guess there are two or three. The first
is that the number one top used port
right now for access to Cloudbot control
is 18789.
The issue with using this port is it's
the default port. When you use the
default port for any application that
you set up, this allows bad actors who
are scraping tens or hundreds of
thousands of websites at once to very
quickly scan a short list of high
probability ports to see whether or not
they're accessible. What that means is
services like Shodan and anybody else
who might have API connection there
won't be able to scan your port at first
go. Why? Because you're not added to
this list of most common ports, meaning
you're not going to be as high risk.
Same thing with all the other usual
suspects. 443, 80, 8080, 3000. Pick a
random number generator. Roll some dice
and set the config up to do that for
you. Don't know what the hell I'm
talking about? That's okay. Just give
Claude Code access to whatever server
you're using to host this puppy since
that's all Claudebot really is anyway.
And tell it, hey, I want you to pick a
non-traditional port. Try port 44892.
The second is to set your damn
passwords. Don't leave it empty.
Services like Shodan and others, and
there are many on the internet, are
constantly scanning all available
gateways. And so if they can access your
Cloudbot control panel and you don't
have a password set, you're going to be
out of luck. Now, from my
knowledge, the vast majority of Cloudbot
instances have their password set,
that's a default setting, but I do have
to point this out. The next is to update
Claudebot to the currently best
available version. Ideally, this won't
cause any what are called breaking
changes, but if you can update to the
most available version, one of the most
egregious of errors, which is that
reverse proxy Nginx thing I've been
talking about, is patched. The issue
obviously is everybody's self-hosting
this stuff, and so there are no
automatic updates. You actually have to
manually go through and push it
yourself. Now, if you're one of those
people that hasn't updated, make sure
you configure gateway.trusted_proxies,
especially if you're running behind this
Nginx/Caddy
reverse proxy setup. The reason why is
because if you don't, the Cloudbot
control panel will treat anybody that
accesses that URL as localhost, which in
layman's terms means it'll basically
just open up its front doors to anybody
that wanders in. Really, if you
absolutely wanted to lock this down
infrastructure-wise, you'd use Tailscale
or some VPN. Again, just ask
Claude Code to set this puppy up for you
since that's obviously what most people
here are doing anyway. Last but not
least, pretend you're me or any of the
other tens of thousands of people that
have set this up over the last 3 days
thinking, "Holy crap I'm going to end
this year Mr. Moneybags because Cloudbot's
going to do all my Twitter research for
me." Well, if you haven't done any
of this stuff yet and you pushed
Cloudbot to a publicly available URL, go
through all of your API keys and rotate
them. Rotation is a feature offered by
most services of renown these days that
basically just allows you to change your
API key specifically in the cases of
leaking it like so many of us have to
literally the entire internet. Now the
other big attack vector was actually at
what's called the supply chain level
which is the suite of skills and tools
that people are using to augment their
Cloudbot instances with more
functionality. I know a lot of people
here are probably familiar with
ClaudeHub. They just renamed it to
MoltHub. And basically, there are a
bunch of different things here you can
add on like web chat, audio
notifications, GOG, decision trees, who
the heck knows. The issue with these
sorts of repositories and databases is
they're not secure out of the gate. I
mean, some person just put this site up
and because of popularity ended up
being one of the most popular sites, but
there's nothing really preventing a bad
actor from putting up their own skill
with some sort of malicious instruction
to get your Clawbot to send all of your
API tokens to somebody. And that's
exactly what this fella Jameson did. He
actually built a simulated backdoor
Claudebot skill for Claude Hub. He then
inflated its download count to over
4,000, which because this is a new
service, MoltHub just ranks you based
directly off of the number of downloads
you've gotten per unit time. It's a very
naive algorithm. With that, he was able
to be highlighted. And so, when
unsuspecting users like myself go to the
front page, see a cool skill, give it a
click, what's going to happen? Well,
they're going to download my super
sneaky backdoor. I won't go too in
depth with what this fella could have
gotten access to. He's a pretty cool guy
as mentioned and so he hasn't used those
API keys for any nefarious purposes. At
least not that we know of, Jameson. But
suffice to say, none of these
repositories, none of these databases or
directories are really secure until
they've been validated by an immense
number of other trusted sources. So the
unfortunate reality is you can't take
things like download counts seriously. I
mean I using Claude Code could
whip up a new MoltHub 2.0 website,
rank the hell out of it using various
SEO techniques, get it somewhere on the
first page, and probably get tens of
thousands of people downloading my BS.
What I mean is, it's not enough just to
Google something and then download a
skill. When we're working with agents,
because these agents have significantly
more autonomy, but also tend to require
a lot more access. We need to be super
super sure that the website that we're
using is legitimate. What are some ways
to do so? Try cross referencing it. Look
it up on social media. See if there's
anybody trusted that you know that's
talking about this website. Obviously,
you can never be 100% sure, but these
are some ways you can at least avoid the
80/20. Next, and this is really
unfortunate because this adds a ton of
latency and friction. I'd recommend you
read every file in a skill before
running it. Don't just read like the top
level skill.md. Actually go through or
better yet feed the entire file to a
fresh Claude or Gemini or ChatGPT or
Codex instance and have it tell you
whether or not that skill does what it
is saying it does. This sort of
third party or third party AI
verification can be pretty useful. If
you have author information, you can
also double check to see if they've got
a real reputation, a real face, and a
linked GitHub. Usually if they have a
linked GitHub with some commit history
and stuff like that. This is more often
than not going to be a real person or at
least it'll be a higher probability that
they are. Why? Because typically
developers and whatnot that put their
real name out there, their real face out
there and that have a verified commit
history, they don't want to lose it,
right? They don't want to put out some
BS that other people quickly identify as
a scam. And finally, for my developer
friends out there, I just treat Claude
Hub and any alternative repo that stores
skills as an early npm right now.
Basically assume that nothing is vetted,
that every package you're downloading is
out there to screw you in some way. And
despite the fact that this will add
significantly more friction to your
life, it'll also ensure that you're not
one of the several thousand bozos on
this list. I honestly really really like
technology like this, but right now I
certainly wouldn't trust all my API keys
with Claudebot, nor my left nut. And
hopefully you guys understand why I'm
saying what I'm saying. So, as the rest
of the internet continues to spear this
red lobster alive, best of luck. This is
the last time I'm going to be talking
about CloudBot on this channel. So,
thanks for bearing with me over the last
couple of days.
