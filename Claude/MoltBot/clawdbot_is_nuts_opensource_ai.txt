Hey guys, welcome to this video. In this
video, we're going to be talking about
Claudebot. Claudebot is a brand new
system that everyone is going absolutely
crazy for on X. This video is going to
be slightly different because I don't
really understand what the hype is here,
but I'm going to try my best to explain
what is going on here. So, the first
thing to note is installation is
extremely easy. You just copy this
command. Whether or not you trust this
to run your entire life, that's up to
you. It's an open-source system, so
there shouldn't be anything too kind of
nefarious on there. Hopefully, people
have checked, but I mean, again, that's
asking a lot of people. What this
actually is is it's basically an AI
assistant that will sit 24/7 that you
can talk to on your computer.
Right. So you can run this on a, you
know, if you have a spare computer and
then you can have a conversation like
the one right here on WhatsApp directly
with Claudebot. Now, the issue I have
straight away with this is nobody's
going to actually use it for this,
right? This is the thing that is kind of
annoying me about this project is I'm
just not seeing the use cases. There are
some, but it's just not as extreme and
crazy as people are going around on X
saying. Like, people are going mad
about Claudebot right now. Like
literally these these eight letters or
whatever just are guaranteed 10,000
impressions on Twitter right now. So
this is what they're talking about.
Claudebot is a 24/7 assistant with access
to its own computer. What if there were
10 or 100 or a thousand all running 24/7
in the cloud with access to your files,
your Gmail, calendar, everything about
you? That's the future living today.
What do you mean? Why would you need a
thousand claude bots running 24/7? What
would you need this for, Nick? Please
just explain to me, Nick. I just don't
get it. Great. You can talk to it on
WhatsApp. Wow, I'm really not
understanding this, guys. And maybe I'm
behind. Got a Mac Mini for Clawbot. Had
a lot of fun setting this up today.
Instead of access to my accounts, I gave
it its own Apple account for messages.
Its own Gmail to sign up for stuff. Its
own GitHub to push code. Okay. So, I
mean this straight away is a little bit
more useful. Instead of having access to
my stuff, I would rather it has access
to its own stuff and it can go and it
can sign up and it can be its own kind
of AI profile. This is a little bit more
useful. Aaron NG, thank you actually for
showing me a decent use case. Should we
add a Claude bot option? Basically, run
Claude code in a sandbox 24/7. You can
text it, WhatsApp it, and it'll be able
to do anything Claude code can do. Not
true. Absolutely not true. If you're not
watching Claude Code run, it's not going
to be the same as Claude Code. It's just
not. Alex Finn, bro, what the - I
have an AI agent watching all my GitHub
repos just coming up with new features,
building them, shipping them, then text
me when they're done. This is how you
completely destroy your project, Alex.
I don't get it. I actually like this guy
and I think that he makes good content,
but you know, this is how you mess up an
entire project. Telling people this, in
my opinion, is just dumb because this is
not how AI coding is done. If you just
let this cook, it will break everything.
I promise you, it will break everything.
The only issue with Clawbot for me is
that it seems to be very token
inefficient. You're going to be burning
tokens like there's no tomorrow. Claude
code for trading is nuts. Classic. They
always just go with this option. Let me
guess, this is crypto. Yep. I don't even
need to see this, honestly. I just know
what's coming.
Okay. So, this one here from tech
friend AJ. I can actually see the use
case here. Deployed clawbot in under
five minutes on AWS free tier. Open
source personal AI. Full system access.
I don't care about interfaces through
WhatsApp. Whatever. People are rigging
it to their Raybands for real-time price
comparisons. One command, that's it.
This is an interesting one. Imagine
having an AWS thing that you can
interact with that you just write to
whenever you want something. I do like
that. And the fact that it can execute
code and run claude code and stuff like
that is pretty interesting. Okay, so
this here, this is where it starts to
get interesting. So Claudebot gateway,
see this? When I see it like this, I can
actually start to understand why people
might like to use something like this.
So this is almost like a virtual
assistant right here. So you can see it
automates daily brief, manga, I don't
know what that is. Evening check content
machine generation and drafting okay
soul.md personality and tone, user who
you are in context, memory.md long-term
knowledge, daily logs, voice messages.
So this is quite cool. Imagine walking
down the street you have an idea for
something you leave a voice note to
claude bot and then you come home from
vacation or whatever and you have a
fleshed out MVP of what you had in your
head. That is a cool idea. That's where
things start to get interesting. Let's
just quickly talk about how to install
and things like that just in case people
actually want to use this. So,
installation, you just run the install
command that's on their homepage. Just
run through their setup. I connected
through Claude code, which I don't think
is even - I think that's against their
TOS. So, just be careful with that. You
might get banned. I have no idea. Not
legal advice. Whatever I have to say.
Also, I don't really like it when
companies blatantly bypass other
companies terms of service, especially
someone like Anthropic, because if I get
banned from Claude, what the hell am I
going to do? Like, literally, what am I
going to do? I'll have to code with Open
Router, which is going to be 100 times
more expensive. So, definitely be
careful with that, guys. Okay? And a lot
of people are just like, "Oh, just do
it." But you know, if you get banned
from Claude and you're using it to code,
what are you going to do next?
Literally. So, let's talk use cases. For
use cases, what I like to do is I like
to go to skills and I like to have a
little look here. This one here, X/
Twitter CLI for reading, searching,
posting, and engagement via cookies.
Now, this use case right here, I just
want you to picture something for one
second. If you remember yesterday or two
days ago, I made a video about agent
skills for remotion which effectively
allows claude code to create motion
graphics for your business. So let's say
I wanted to advertise harbor seo.ai. How
can I use that for this? Well, what
Claudebot could do would be to basically
look through my system, my code or, you
know, the website itself, whatever. It
doesn't really matter because it can
make an account. And then what it would
do is it would come and it would create
motion videos, right? Motion graphics.
Once it's created a motion graphic, it
can use Claudebot to then post these
motion graphics and engage with people
on X. This will get people to your
business, right? This is actually a
really, really good way to do things.
Blog watcher, another very interesting
one. Monitor blogs and RSS atom feeds
for updates using the Blog Watcher CLI.
Again, let's say I wanted to add a new
feature on Scout. This was an original
feature of scout on harbor. Right now,
this just finds trending topics, but
let's just say there was another option
here. Originally, what scout was
supposed to do was to scout your
competitors, right? So imagine if you
came here, you set up your competitors
and then all I would have to do is send
your competitor URLs to my Claudebot and
it would basically 24/7 scout your
competitors and then web hook back into
Harbor and basically show you when a
competitor has written an article. It
would basically use Harbor to write a
similar article in your style with your
images and everything. And that's a very,
very interesting use case. So, to be
honest with you, this is actually the
second time I'm making this video. The
first time I made this video, I was kind
of confused and I didn't really know
what the use cases were. But being able
to have a 24/7 running bot that you can
wake up at any time that will do
anything for you by interfacing with
either WhatsApp or Telegram or whatever
is actually very, very interesting. What
I would love them to do is have a way
that you can basically just have some
kind of chat app on your phone where you
can discuss things with Claudebot. Now,
I'm pretty sure they will already have
this, but if they don't, I would love
this because and another thing as well
is with teleporting. I don't think I
don't know if people have seen this, but
teleporting Claude code. This is a new
thing where you can basically teleport
between one Claude code session to
another Claude Code session. So imagine
if this was inside Claudebot where let's
say I'm coding and this happens all the
time. I'm coding on Claude code. I have
to leave and I want to just continue my
conversation with Claude code. If
Claudebot can make that happen, that
would be an insane use case. Guys, I
think overall this is a pretty
interesting thing. I don't necessarily
get the hype as much as other people.
I'm not really sure why people are so
crazy about this because I'm pretty sure
you could do all of this before just
with maybe slightly customized setup.
But yeah, I don't know. People are going
absolutely mad for it on X. So, I just
thought I'd make this video and let
people draw their own conclusions. I'll
leave the video there, guys. Thank you
so much for watching. If you're watching
all the way to the end of the video,
you're absolutely legend. And I'll see
you very, very soon with some more
content. Peace out.
