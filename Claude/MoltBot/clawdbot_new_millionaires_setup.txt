Guys, this is the second video in a row
where what I'm about to show you even I
can't believe is happening. But earlier
this month, this tool called Claudebot
was released to the world and it gives
our coding agents its entire computer.
And in this way, we now have 24/7 AI
employees that work all the time on any
task that we want. And the best part is
that we can talk to this coding agent
from anywhere on the planet on like
iMessage or Discord or WhatsApp. And
this tool has become so freaking
powerful that I'm going to have to make
many videos about that. But today, I'm
going to show you just the quick
introduction to what Claudebot is and how
to actually get it set up so that in the
future videos you guys can all follow
along perfectly. Today's video overview
is going to go through four chapters.
I'm going to be explaining why Claudebot
is so exciting for anyone that's
building automations or agents or SaaS
with AI. I'm going to go through the six
powerful features that makes Claudebot so
game-changing. And then I'm going to show
you guys a quick demo of how I actually
use Claudebot to do a lot of tasks just
by texting it on iMessage. And then
we're going to go ahead and we're going
to set up Claudebot step by step. Now,
the reason why I'm making this video is
that over the past day, I've been
building out different use cases for
this Claudebot engine. And now I have
over a hundred use cases to show you
guys. But first, you guys need to learn
what Claudebot is, why it's powerful,
and how to set it up. So, why is this so
exciting? Simply put, Claudebot can do
any task and it runs locally on our
computers. Hence why I already bought a
couple of Mac Minis to make sure that
this agent's ready to go.
We can also chat with this Claudebot
agent without being on our computer. So
for the first time ever, I could just be
on the golf course building out apps,
building out agents and running my
business. And we do this by messaging
our agent through iMessage, Discord,
WhatsApp or any other messaging platform
that you want. So what this means is
every agentic workflow that lived in
n8n for example, every computer use agent
that we built on Playwright, every
messaging platform that we wanted to
build automations for can now live
inside of this simple agentic framework
that works 24/7. This is absolutely
magic. Once again, like I can't believe
I'm even making this video. So here are
the six reasons why Claudebot is going to
change the entire AI landscape. And
these are the six core reasons. So the
first one is that it has built-in
computer use tools. It has the Chrome
developer tools and it also has the
Playwright MCP tools. Meaning we can
within an iMessage prompt tell our agent
to open up its own browser and do a task
on our behalf and it can sign into those
browsers and hold on to those session
cookies. So, if you guys saw my computer
use tutorials, you saw that the reason
why computer use agents are so powerful
is that we can give them cookie sessions
to any software provider. So, if I use
LinkedIn for example, I can give my
Claudebot my LinkedIn access and then it
can use my LinkedIn account to send
messages, drop comments, make posts, so
on and so forth with every type of
software provider. Now, the next reason
why this is so powerful is that all of
this runs locally. So when you sign into
like Instagram or LinkedIn, you have
your IP address and then you also have
your session cookie. If you were to host
this on like a virtual private server
for example, then you're not going to be
able to use any of these software
logins as reliably because your IP
address will keep changing. So with
Claudebot, we can just within a prompt
sign into any social provider or any
software provider and then we can save
the session cookies and then this agent
can access that website or software
whenever we want. Now another reason why
running it on the Mac Mini is so
powerful, this gives us every single
macOS tool. So we can use the terminal,
we can use the notes, we can use the
Apple notification triggers. So, we can
tell Claudebot to create a notification
that triggers off once a day and sends
me a text message or sends me an email
or gives me a phone call. Now, that's
just one reason why having it on a Mac
Mini is so powerful. The second reason
why is that the agent will have access
to the GPU, the CPU, the RAM, and all of
the memory. So, it's going to be able to
use the full power of your computer
without you actually being on the
computer. Same thing goes with all of
the files, the videos, the audios, and
the images that is built into your
computer or that you've saved to your
computer. It can go and access these
files again without you being there.
Now, this relays itself into the third
feature where we can essentially be vibe
coding from anywhere on the planet. Now,
because Claudebot has access to Claude
Code, it also can have access to your
GitHub repositories. And GitHub is where
all of my code bases live, for example.
And so I can tell my agent here to go
grab a GitHub repository and then add it
to any project that we want. So this is
going to allow us to yeah obviously do
vibe coding, but also if there's a skill
that we want to give our Claudebot agent,
we could just tell it to go and get that
skill and then it can write the skill
and add it in which we'll get into in a
sec. Now, in 2025, the biggest AI
automation platform by far was n8n. And
one of the core powers of n8n was that
we can build a workflow and then we can
set up the workflow to run on a
schedule. And that is just simply called
a cron job. And inside of
Claudebot, you have the full ability to
set up any type of cron that you want.
So, let's say we're working with Claude
Code and Claudebot to build out an
automated workflow. And I was doing this
just by messaging the agent. And then
the agent goes, "The workflow is working
well." We can then set up that
workflow to run autonomously at any time
in the day as much as we need it to
run. So this is going to be insanely
game-changing and I'm going to be
showing you guys the hundred use cases
that I have in the next video for
Claudebot. And it has a lot to do with
this feature right here.
Now, one of the most fun features which
just felt like magic again was being
able to just chat with the Claudebot
agent from my phone. So, in the demo
that I show you guys today, I'm going to
show you how I was just literally
chatting on iMessage, sending Claudebot
commands, and it would go ahead and do
literally whatever I wanted. It created
a Supabase account. It signed into my
GitHub. It pulled in a GitHub
repository. And then I just decided to
film this video. But I'm just going to
keep working on it cuz it is just
ridiculous. Now, the most critical point
about everything that has happened in AI
recently is that skills allow our agents
to be very specialized in their
workflows. So, we can now give Claudebot
any one of the skills that we've built
in our other repositories that live
inside of the Claudebot ecosystem, so on
and so forth. And in this way, we are
going to build a truly autonomous, fully
stacked AI employee that is going to
help you and your business grow faster.
I want to show you the demo of me using
Claudebot. So, I'm just going to head
over into my messages and we can see
this agent called Zeus. So, I want to
just scroll up to the top of the chat
cuz this is like pretty ridiculous. So,
we start off the conversation. I go,
"What up?" He goes, "Yo, Kevin, iMessage
is live." Blah, blah, blah. And
then I start asking questions. We're
going to be working on some computer use
workflows and that uses Chrome dev
tools and Playwright. I was like do you
already have that set up? And then the
agent goes yeah I already have Playwright
set up and I have browser control
enabled and all that fun stuff. So it
says all set. You can start using
computer use tools. And then it starts
asking like what's the workflow
you want to build. And then I go the
next question I have for you is
are you going to be able to set up
cron schedules just for me texting
you? Like if we have
a workflow that's already winning, can I
just tell you to set it up on a
schedule? And then the agent goes, "Yep,
I can set up cron schedules for you
whenever you want. No need to touch the
computer."
Which is just ridiculous. And the agent
goes, once we nail a workflow, I can
immediately create a cron job with
whatever schedule you want, enable and
disable it, update the schedule to later
or more often and run it manually to
actually test that it's working. So, we
can build a workflow, test the workflow,
and then set it on a schedule all just
by texting the agent on any
messaging platform. In this case,
iMessage. Then the next question I had
had to do with agent skills because I
have a bunch of agent skills in my other
repositories like Instaly.app, like Creator
OS. And I was like, how do you get these
skills? And then the agent goes, all I
have to do is get your GitHub
repositories and then I can pull in
those GitHub repositories and get full
access. So then I go, let's integrate
GitHub. What this agent then does is it
goes to GitHub on my computer, signs in,
and then sends me the verification code.
It says, "Enter the code, authorize it,
and let me know when you're in." And
then I tell it that I'm done. And then
the agent says, "I'm logged in to your
GitHub repository." Which is absolutely
ridiculous. So then after doing that, I
was like pretty shocked. I was like
pretty excited. I was like, "Okay, what
do I ask it next?" So I was like, "How
do we get cookie sessions?" because for
us to do automations on software
providers like LinkedIn for example, we
need the cookie sessions to that login
provider. So I go, are you going to
be able to do that? The agent goes, yes,
I can handle multiple cookie sessions.
So after it responded with that, I go,
that's very interesting because now, for
example, I can build an entire swarm of
AI employees as part of Creator OS that
will just be a part of my business,
right? And they can all be doing
different actions on LinkedIn, on any
social provider and they all can just be
inside of this one Claudebot. And so this
conversation continued and I wanted
to see how far we can take it before
filming this tutorial. And then I go
like, can we set up a Supabase
database? It goes, yes, I'm going to use
this Gmail provider to create the
Supabase. That's exactly what I did. So
that's the first thing you got to do.
And the second thing you got to do,
guys, is you do got to buy a separate
computer. I do not recommend you running
Claudebot on your personal computer
because that'll give it access, for
example, to your personal iMessage, to
your personal Gmail. And when you're
setting up workflows, you don't want to
be randomly sending emails to people,
randomly sending messages, or
potentially even getting hacked. So, I
do definitely recommend getting a Mac
Mini. I was just very lucky to predict
this. So, I bought these a couple months
ago, but yeah, that's essentially
what you need to get set up. But now
let's hop right back into the computer
and let's just show you exactly how to
get Claudebot set up in Cursor. And so in
Chrome, I'm literally just going to type
Claudebot installation. We're going to
choose that first link. And this is the
quick install command. So this curl
command is also going to be in the
description, so you can go and find it
there. I'm going to copy that. And now
I'm just going to head into Cursor and
get that set up. Cool. So we're going to
go open project. I'm going to click new
folder. I'm going to call this Claudebot
agent. We're going to click create and
we're going to open that up.
Great. So now we're going to add in
Claude Code. I'm going to click that
toggle back. We're going to hit the
toggle on the top right. We're going to
type in claude. That should bring up the
chat. There we go. And we're also going
to open up another terminal. So I'm just
going to click this plus button. We're
going to move up this terminal to the top.
I'm going to paste in that command. And
we're going to download the Claudebot
installer. And we're just going to let
that go ahead. All right. There we go.
So now it's going to say like, I
understand this is powerful and
inherently risky. Do you want to
continue? Yeah, obviously we want to
continue. So, we're going to go into the
quick start. So, the next step here is
to choose which AI provider you want to
be giving to the agent. For us, I'm
always using Claude Opus 4.5 at this
point because of how powerful it is. And
it's going to ask you to run this
command in a new terminal. So, the
claude setup-token. So, I'm going to go
and click the plus button. That's going
to give us another terminal. And I'm
just going to type in claude setup-token.
Now, what this did is it opened
up a browser in the other monitor that
I have. And I'm just going to click
authorize. Now, what this is going to
give us is this OAuth token, which I'm
going to blur out because I don't want
to be sharing my Claude Code credits.
They're very, very precious. But once
you get that, you want to copy it and
you just want to hand it over to the
Claudebot agent. And that should give
it access to Anthropic and all of the
Anthropic AI models. So, I'm just going
to name what this is. We're going to
name it Claudebot agent tutorial.
And now we get to choose which AI model
we want to use inside of Anthropic. So
I'm going to be using Opus 4.5. And now
we get to choose which format we want to
be communicating with our Claude agent.
So we have Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord,
Google Chat. What I love doing is
iMessage because it's just so
satisfying. So we're going to go ahead
with iMessage. Now, one other thing you
got to do on the computer is you got to
give your disk full access to Cursor and
full access to the terminal. So, I want
to show you how that works really quick.
I'm going to go over to the Apple logo.
I'm going to click system settings. I'm
going to scroll down to privacy and
security. I'm going to go and find the
full disk access. And we can see here
I've given Cursor and the Node terminals
full disk access to whatever they want
to do on this computer. So, they have
full access. And once you do that,
that'll give it access to the iMessage
and all the files and all that fun
stuff. So the next step here is to
configure all of the Claudebot skills
that actually just come with the
package. So I'm going to click yes for
the configure. I'm going to choose npm
as my skill install command. And now we
have all of these different dependencies
that we could be adding to our agent.
Right? So CamSnap, for example, gives
this Claudebot agent access to its own
camera. So, like if I had a camera set
up somewhere and I wanted to take a
video or take pictures without me being
there, that's what I would use this for.
But I'm not going to go through all of
these today. But basically, the ones
that I'm going to turn on is Claude Hub,
MC Porter, Nano PDF, OpenAI, Whisper,
Peekaboo, Summarize, Things Mac, and
there are more, but since I've already
installed it in the past, the other ones
are already installed. So, I'm just
going to go ahead and now install all of
these new dependencies and all of these
skill sets that out the box the Claudebot
agent will have. So, it's asking for
some API keys. So, it's asking for like
the Google Places API key. I don't want
any of these, but you can obviously add
them. Now, with my real Claudebot
instance, I did give it Nano Banana
access so it can create images, but in
this case, I'm just going to say no.
Same thing with OpenAI. Same thing with
Whisper and so on and so forth. Now the
next thing I want to talk about is the
hooks. Now the hooks are very
interesting because this is how we can
actually see what's happening with our
Claudebot agent behind the scenes. So
the two hooks that I enabled is the
command logger and the session memory.
So I'm going to do that again here. And
what the command logger does is any time
that the Claudebot agent actually runs a
command or executes code, it'll then
store what it did inside of an audit
file. And so we can actually review what
it did when we get back onto our
computer and we can use this information
to improve the workflows that it's
working on. The same thing applies with
the session memory. So let's say we are
working on an agentic workflow and the
agent is running into errors, running
into errors, but then it figures out a
solution. It's going to write out what
was that solution in the session
context. And so we want to make sure
that the session memory is persistent so
that the next time that we run that
workflow, the agent's able to go ahead
and actually complete that task without
running into errors. So I'm going to
enable those hooks. Now the next thing
that's going to happen is this thing
called the Claudebot gateway, which is
essentially like the front end of
Claudebot. So once this opens up, we will
go and chat about that. And so what this
did is it created this website instance
for us. So this is our entire kind of
operating system dashboard for Claudebot.
It has our chat, but we also have all of
the channels. It has access to the
instances. It has access to sessions,
cron jobs, skills, nodes. And this is
why I'm so excited about Claudebot
because all of the workflows just like
how we were doing it on n8n in 2025 are
going to be inside of a platform like
this in 2026. So this is guaranteed like
the thing that you guys should be
learning, going all in on. So now the
agent goes, "Hey, I just came online.
Fresh start, blank slate, no memories
yet, no name, no idea who I am or who
are you. So who are you and what do you
want me to be? I could be anything
really. Do you have any ideas?" So in
today's video, I just want to show you
guys how we can set this up to chat with
on iMessage. I'm just going to say, I
want to be able to communicate with you
via iMessage. When you first set up
Claudebot with iMessage, all you have to
do is send yourself a text message. This
is going to create something called a
pairing code. So, I already ran that
message. So, I'm using my personal Gmail
on this computer and I said, you know,
just a "what up" message. Then the agent
responds back saying access not
configured. And you want to share this
pairing code with the Claudebot
environment. So, I'm just going to copy
this. I'm going to say this is the
pairing code that the iMessage gave me.
And I'm going to paste that in. And just
like that, we've just connected the
iMessage. So the agent goes done. You're
approved. The notification failed on
iMessage at first, but now it's set up.
So I'm going to go back into the chat.
I'm going to say, "What up, Claudebot?"
And there we go. We got that response.
So the agent goes, "Hey, it works. Look
at us. You're texting me like a real
person now. iMessage gang." So we were
in the middle of something blah blah
blah blah blah. And it's now trying to
get the actual setup. But my setup is
using a completely different Mac Mini
and a completely different iMessage
account so that when we have this
conversation, it's very fluid, right?
Because if I was messaging myself, I get
my own message back as well. It's not as
good. And then also, this agent now has
access to my iMessage, meaning if anyone
were to text me, this agent would
actually respond, which is crazy, right?
So, you want to set this up on its own
iMessage account, right? So, here, for
example, I can be like, "What up, dude?"
And this will only respond back one
message. And there we go. So, yo, just
chilling, keeping the lights on. What's
good? Ready to build something or just
checking in. It's just ridiculous. So,
now that you guys know how to set up
Claudebot, in the next video I'm going to
be running you guys through the most
powerful use cases that I've already
identified using something like Claudebot
for computer use workflows, for agentic
workflows, for essentially anything,
even iMessage messaging. Right. So, we
can now give contacts to Zeus and let
him send out marketing campaigns with
iMessage. Yeah. I'm really excited to
show you guys the next video. So, I'm
just going to leave it here.
