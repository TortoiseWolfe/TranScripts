Do you remember that whole idea about
one person building a billion dollar
company with no employees, no human
workers? I think the clock on that has
just started. This beefy fella is Peter
Steinberger. Andre Karpathy posted a
huge post just a few hours ago about
where coding is heading. Not just
coding, just software engineering in
general. He's asking what it's going to
feel like in the future, like playing
Starcraft, playing a Factorio, playing
music. Someone responds, "10x engineer
can be a one-man army. There could be
soon a one-person billion-dollar
company." Andre responds tagging Peter
Steinberger saying, "You can do it." So
Peter, he came back from retirement to
mess with AI and help build the lobster
to take over the world. After watching
this video, I think you'll agree with me
this is going to be the year of the
lobster. Oh, also Peter is polyagent
amorous. Polyagent amorous, meaning that he
likes a lot of agents. He does it
with a lot of agents at the same time,
if you know what I mean. And this is the
thing he built, Cloudbot. Now,
obviously, this isn't sponsored. This is
an open source project. It's hackable,
meaning anybody can contribute to it,
use it. It's basically free. You
might have to pay for the AI frontiers,
their models, their tokens, API costs,
but this thing is free. If you search
for it on Google Trends, it's got one of
the wildest search curves that I've
ever seen. It's just flat and then it's
just vertical. Like the entire world is
like what is this thing? So in this
video, let's take a look at who this
person is. Who is this man? What in
God's name did he just build and what
would it look like if Arnold
Schwarzenegger was born in modern
times and instead of going into
bodybuilding decided to go into AI?
Here's a quick clip from Unicorn Mafia
where Peter talks about his project
Claude Code. This is where I believe it
was just first revealed to the world.
And at the end, I'll show you how to use
it, how to install it, and how to get
cranking on the thing because I mean,
really, you should be using this. This
is a glimpse into the future as you'll
see. Take a look.
I'm Peter. I'm originally from Austria
and my latest project is Cloudbot. I was
playing with for a while like because I
use Claude Code or at least I use Claude
Code also to manage my computer to do
like I don't know random file
management, everything. So, what would
happen if we up the game a little bit?
Plot is kind of like I don't know,
Jarvis, maybe a little bit like Her. If
you've seen those movies, it's an
agent that runs on either your
computer or in the cloud. You can
install it on everywhere. It's just
TypeScript and it can access pretty much
anything you want. So, Cloudbot has
access to my emails, my calendar, my
files, through Tailscale, basically
my whole network, my cameras, the
temperature of my bed. It can order
food for me. It can pretty much do
everything. It can also do MCPs if
you're into that stuff. But why not show
you? Say hi. All right. So, my
preferred, we support right now WhatsApp,
Telegram, Slack, Discord. Somebody
submitted MS Teams and I regretfully
merged it. And also Zalo,
Matrix and it has a whole plugin
architecture. So, basically, you can
install an npm and add your own
messaging service. So, there's more to
come, but let's just say let's just make
Claude say hi.
Hello everyone. I am Claude, the space
lobster AI assistant. It is an absolute
pleasure to meet you all at demo day.
Remember, we don't exterminate, we
exfoliate.
Yeah, I'm a Doctor Who fan and I went
with a space lobster theme. So, it came
up with exfoliate. And that's where we
go. So, it also has access to my
cameras. I can just ask you, show me the
cameras in my London apartment. Any
interesting emails? Oh, but actually
this is much better because the beauty is
you can access it from anywhere. Oh,
yeah. I see. I put them a little bit
into private mode so you don't see too
much. Also, my cleaning lady keeps
moving them to the background every time
she's there. Can you show us a
picture of yourself? How do you see
yourself? You can also do voice
messages, of course, because it's much
nicer. And maybe also a video. I
think you made one before and I IQ.
So, even you can hook it up
in a group chat.
Here's how I see myself. A majestic
space lobster foliating through the
cosmos. Hard shell, soft heart, ready to
exfoliate. Oh, it was complaining
because it was creating a video and
apparently lobsters are like not safe
for work. So, it was keeping blocked because
lobsters are too dangerous with their
claws. So, now it made a really cute
little lobster and was like, at least I
got that. There's of course agents.md
with all the basic system prompt. I
don't use Claude Code underneath
anything. I use my own harness so I
have more control over the identity
loop. Then we have an identity file
that's basically everything about me.
Then we have a soul.md which is kind of
like the core values and like how the
agent should act. Then it also
has an identity and the really cool
thing is if you go on the website
and you just want to try it out. Let's
see if that works. I speak fluent bash,
star customer and aggressive tab
completion energy. It starts with a
blank canvas. I put a lot of care
into the first run experience so you
don't get a random AI that's boring. You
can make a sassy space lobster or
smart fox or I don't know what we're
going to do. Let's see if it
crashes. This project kind of took
off. If you can, oh, yeah. This
is my GitHub. If you want to find me,
build way too many projects. I kind of
had to build an army of CLIs
because I very much believe CLIs are
better than MCPs. For example, while Mr.
I forgot the name. Cloudflare talked
about CLIs.
Matt, I just used McPorter, one of my
projects to build a CLI out of an MCP
because turns out agents are really good
at calling CLIs. CLIs scale really well.
You can have like a few thousand or
100,000 on your computer and it still
works and it's progressive disclosure.
So I just have to know that there is a
CLI. Then I call help on it. Then I get
like what the CLI can do and then I call
it. That's kind of like how Unix works.
And you can just package every MCP in
the world through McPorter into CLI. And
yes, I totally got the idea from
Cloudflare when I built it. They also
did random stuff in the terminal.
Why not? Yolo here. This is like the
one of the Cloudflare MCPs through
McPorter. You get a nice TypeScript API
that your agent can call. But that's not
the point. This was the speech
you saw was through 11 Labs. So I built
a CLI for that. I have a CLI to
summarize. So the model can be
context smart. I built a CLI for Google
because freaking Google has no CLI to
actually manage all your stuff. I
guess I have to do everything myself.
This project is really interesting
because usually when I do stuff on
Twitter, I get a lot of response, but
nobody really got it because it's like a
new product defining category. Like
nobody really had personal agents before
and we still too much box into
our thinking that coding agents are for
coding when they're like really clever
beasts and can do anything. For example,
I tell you a story. I started this. It
didn't, it wasn't called Cloudbot. It
was called WhatsApp Relay because I just
wanted something where I can type
in little commands from when I'm not at
my computer to run at my computer. And I
hacked it together in like 2 hours. Very
simple. But I usually use prompts when
I do anything. So I wanted to
have image support. So I built something
where if somebody sends an image from
WhatsApp, I just pass on the file path
and the agent will be smart enough
to load itself. And then I was in
Morocco and I was playing with it a lot.
It was fun. And at some point I wasn't
thinking and just sent a voice message.
And then 10 seconds later the model just
replied with the answer. And I'm like,
how the hell did you do that? And the
model was like, yeah, you sent a file,
but there was no file ending because I
didn't program it. So I looked at the
headers and I saw that it was Opus. So I
used FFmpeg to convert it to WAV. And
then I wanted to use Whisper, but you
didn't have Whisper installed. But I
found this OpenAI API key. So I sent it
to OpenAI, translated it, and then here I
am. And I'm like,
that's why I kind of saw the
potential. These beasts are just
incredibly smart at general purpose
problem solving. My god, you have no
taste. What else can you do? Ah, the app
is bad. What else can you do? Tell us
a little bit. Show us. Give us the full
rundown. Maybe also tweet that you're at
demo day. Of course, I have an embedded
browser as well. So, because giving a
model full access to your whole system
and your network is not crazy enough, I
thought, can we up it a notch? So, I
added a heartbeat function that just
calls the agent in every configured
model like every 10 minutes, get a
heartbeat with the prompt that says
surprise me. And the model can either
decide to send a token back like
heartbeat, okay? So, you don't see
anything, or it can check up on you. So,
I have client apps, so the model
knows if I'm working on my computer.
Sometimes it looks at my screen and
roasts me. It can also click because I
built Peekaboo so it can
take over my full screen. Like sometimes
I have Codex open. I go to get food.
I'm like is this done already? And it
would check my screen and type in
continue for me. It has memory. So I
would say still primitive. It's like a
markdown file a day and then some
vector search over it. But it works damn
well I would say. Here you can see it's
now tweeting. This is its own browser.
So I use, I started with
Playwright but I hacked it and made it a
lot better. So it happily checks the I'm
not a bot checkboxes. Then
come on you can find the post button. It
checked me in on my British Airways
flight because I did a keynote at a
conference yesterday. I was sweating a
little bit because to check in it
actually had to find my passport on my
Dropbox, get the key out and it did all
of that and then it was
bitching about the shadow DOM. So,
here we are. Did a tweet. Please don't
do a second one. What else do we have
here? Yeah, I'll show you how to create
your own. So, I recommend you only use
a really good model like Opus 4.5,
which has pretty good prompt injection
resistance. I hacked on this for a while. I saw
everyone that I showed it in person was
hooked and on Twitter I got very
limited response. I was like, what can
I do to actually make people believe? If
you see the graph here, can you guess
where I figured out how to get the
graph? I made a Discord and I just
hooked my bot into the public
Discord. That was before I implemented
sandboxing. So, I was sweating a little
bit, but turns out yeah, this is our
Discord. We grew within like 10 days
to almost 5,000 people. There's a whole
bunch of AI researchers and CEOs
in there like the Planet Scale and
Convex, a whole bunch of people who
do models. So, it's a really cool place. Was a
really crazy one. But so, and people tried to
trick it into getting stuff
out, but it was basically laughing at
them the whole time. So, I wouldn't say
this is safe. I'm sure
eventually this will be prompt injected
because nobody has a great solution for
that yet. But to me, this is just insanely useful. I use it every
day, not just to manage my life, but
also as a co-worker. Like, I give it an
open source repository that's like,
"Check this out. Play around with this."
And it tries the CLI, tells me, "Oh,
no, there's a bug. I had to compile it."
Blah, blah, blah. This is not better
than this. It also helps me to keep track of my fitness goals. It has
access to my health data. So, it knows when I didn't sleep well
enough. It will nag me. It will
nag me if my weight goes up. This
is far better than any fitness trainer
because the more information you give
those little monsters, the more tailored
it can be. Like it knows exactly that
I'm at demo day right now. And it will
keep remembering that, at least bits of
it, if I remember it. So, I'll show you a
little bit the first run experience
because I'm quite proud of it. Now, you
all have to look away because I have to
find the Anthropic token. And I know
those are in high demand.
Anthropic tried to cut us off because
they now have their the Teemo the Teemo
one co-work. Here we go. Enjoy. Then you
can configure the channel. I built a lot
of skills. It installs a launchd
daemon on Linux, on Mac OS. It also
works with Linux. Windows works with WSL,
works better, but it works. And then
the first run experience is for,
of course you can do it in web but I like
the terminal more. I also built a TUI
and then it basically says hello who
am I? What am I? What are you? You are
Gollum. Let's see what's coming there.
Yes, he likes it. Precious. It feeds us.
And then it also picks an emoji because
it's kind of a thing.
I have the space lobster emoji.
Every creature gets their own
emoji and I guess the swampy
creature is good. I like the swampy
creature. And I'm Peter and I'm at a demo
in London right now. So there's like 100
people watching you. Yeah, it's bugging
out. Let's see what it's saying. We like,
oh yeah, the ring emoji. 100 presses in
London. So this is basically the
startup. It has a bootstrap.md,
again everything is very simple. You
don't need high-tech for that. And you
feed it with some information. It
will create the identity files, the soul
files, and it's also allowed to update
them. You're recommended that
you put it in git, so it backs up its
own work directory. It also has
cron jobs. It also has sub agents, so
everything that's a little longer, it
can spin up sub agents. It can
remember you. Like I use it as an
alarm clock and it has control of my
Sonos speakers and also my computer.
So, it can both check on how much did
I sleep and then slowly change the
lights because I use Philips Hue and it
has control of the lights as well. It
can check on the camera if I'm actually
awake or not. Some people say I'm
building Skynet here but with claws.
And oh yeah, it also built a game.
So, this is my own app
trying to get me cookies. Make
sound effects the Space Invader game. I
integrate quite deeply with Tailscale.
So, it has, one of the
features also is a web server. So you
can just put files in a server. It'll
automatically be distributed. So the
model doesn't have to do too much
and you can totally use it as an
experimentation. There's also native
apps. You can put it on the wall like
it builds a morning report with a custom
dynamic interface where I have
buttons. When I click a button, a prompt
is sent back to the model and it updates
the interface. That stuff is still a
little bit slow, but it's a
transitionary problem. I think this
is a glimpse into the future.
All right, let's claw into ClawdBot
and see exactly what this thing can do,
which is a lot. But first and foremost,
it comes with a warning. Like a legit
warning. There's a reason why this thing
wasn't made by the Frontier AI Labs, by
Google, by Anthropic, by OpenAI. This is
an open-source project. The reason why
Labs won't release anything like this
anytime soon is because there's
going to be a lot of people that are
going to be absolutely wrecked by this
thing. They're going to do something
that they didn't know was dangerous. And
it is dangerous and data is going to get
lost. They're going to get hacked. All
sorts of bad stuff is going to happen.
As a lot of people have pointed out,
there's going to be disasters coming.
We'll touch on that a little bit later.
Basically, what Cloudbot is, is it's your
24/7 AI assistant employee that will take
a stab at anything you want it to. You
hook it up to all your tools, your
calendar, your email. You can even run
it on your main computer where
you have all your files and whatnot. And
the sheer amount of stuff it can do is
amazing. It can automate a lot of
things. It can be incredibly powerful.
So, really fast, here's some
things that people have managed to do
with ClawdBot. So, here's Alex Finn.
He just wanted to see what would happen
if he texted Henry. That's what he named
his ClawdBot to make a reservation for me
next Saturday restaurant. When the Open
Table reservation didn't work, it used
11 Labs to call the restaurant and
complete the reservation. As here, 99%
of people have no clue. So, I hooked up
my Cloudbot to 11 Labs. And yeah, I was
pretty impressed how quickly and easily
it's able to use the 11 Labs API to
create a voice. So, while I haven't
tried this particular thing, I
believe it. So since Claude Code can be
connected to 11 Labs to produce AI
voice. It's connected to your calendar.
It's able to, it also asks to
connect to Google Places. So I set the
Google API there. So it's able to get
data on actual restaurants and other
businesses and locations. Stuff like
this is very possible and it's only
going to get better. So as Finn is
saying here, Claude Code can learn to do
anything. You just ask it to learn it.
You don't need to explain it. It'll
figure it out. Few days ago he told it
to learn how to talk. Here's an 11 Labs
key. Learn how to use it. Same thing for
being able to use Twilio. I want you
to be able to make phone calls for me.
Please build skills for Twilio so you
have a phone number. 11 Labs so you have
a voice and Deepgram so you can
listen. Tell me anything you need from
me. I literally just posted that into
the ClawdBot. And let's see. Let's
see where it takes us. Maybe it'll be
done by the end of this video. What's
interesting is it saying any particular
voice you want me to use. I can clone
yours if you want with a little smirking
face. This is why we need AI safety to
be a serious priority. I don't want this
thing cloning my voice and just running
off of it. Apparently, some people are
using it to create Claude Code tamagotchis.
So, it's an actual like a little
representation of ClawdBot doing
stuff. So, people are using it to check
incoming spam, remove spam, incoming
messages. You can have it sorted by
urgent and non-urgent. Sync to Google
Places, create issues on GitHub,
generate a nice PDF summary of car
conversations. You can use it to
impersonate yourself in a group chat
with friends. It has its own 1Password
vault it can read and write to.
So it can save all the passwords. You
can give it a bunch of passwords for
specific things you want to have access
to. It can give you a daily morning
brief. Research people before
meetings and create briefing docs. I
think you get the idea. The sheer amount
of stuff this thing can do is kind of
mind-boggling because you have
intelligence plus the ability to connect
to all the stuff that you do online and
in fact with these voice things actually
call real life people, get reservations,
etc. Can be your fitness coach yelling
at you if you're not doing enough stuff.
It connects to all of your fitness data.
It can go on X and do research, find the
right posts. It can run 24/7 and getting
you all the stuff that you need. As
Ethan Mollick said here, "Good night,
Claude. I hope these projects are done
by morning." I think that in the future
the biggest productivity hack will be to
make sure you have enough stuff that
you've given Cloudbot or Claude Code or
whatever AI assistant we're using. Just
before you go to sleep, make sure it has
a full schedule and to-do list
that needs to complete by the time
you're awake. Give it a week's worth of
tasks. Say good night and go to sleep.
You wake up to massive amounts of
progress, tons of completed tasks,
reports, research completed, projects
built, etc. It's like Christmas morning
every morning. One of the cool things it
asks you to do, you don't have to, but
you can hook it up to some messaging
service. In my case, I used WhatsApp.
It was just the easiest, most available,
but there's tons. You can use Slack,
Discord, Telegram, like anywhere where
you're chatting. You can have a separate
workspace where you're communicating to
ClawdBot, telling it what to do. It's
responding back to you with what it's
doing or taking care of some biological
functions, texting back and forth,
having it complete stuff for you. Here's
Dave Kiss. He's saying he rebuilt his
entire site via Telegram while watching
Netflix. Embedded Notion to Astro. 18
posts migrated. DNS moved to Cloudflare.
Never opened my laptop. Now you can of
course install Cloudbot on your main
computer, but that comes with some
dangers. It also currently is native to
Mac, so it works the best on Mac. A lot
of people got to buying these Mac Minis
and just having Cloudbot live on it,
basically doing everything it needs on
that device, which I got to say is kind
of insane if you think about it. You got
this physical object sitting somewhere
on your desk, which is basically a 24/7
employee going about your business,
which might be a thing in the future at
some point where it gets too
complicated. We have too many of these
AI agents running around that we have to
manage. Having some sort of a visual
representation of each might be
beneficial. Whether it's a character on
screen or a physical real life
object like this, I think it
would help our brains keep
everything organized. Some people even
run Cloudbot on old Android phones. So
it looks something like this. Each one
is basically running its own version. So
you got three agents, at least three
because a lot of them can spin off their
own sub agents to run on various
tasks. What can you use it for? Twitter
research, market monitoring, and
Telegram chat daily summaries. Private
groups signal flashing to his main
phone. So if you have an old phone
sitting somewhere in your drawer, turn
it into 24/7 AI server. I'll link this
down below if people want to run this,
but Mac Mini energy, junk drawer budget.
Also, a lot of people are just
purchasing virtual private servers
online and hosting it on there.
So, instead of running it on your device
or even a Mac Mini or a phone, you just
go to one of these providers, set up
your CloudBot on there, you can have
many different instances, and
basically have it run in the VPS. Here's
a person saying, "Cloud disaster
incoming. If this trend of hosting
Cloudbot on VPS instances keeps up along
with people not reading the docs and
opening ports with zero authorization,
I'm scared we're going to have a massive
credentials breach soon and it can be
huge. This is a basic scan of instances
hosting Cloudbot with open gateway
ports and a lot of them have zero auth."
There are some counterarguments
to this. This is ZD. He's saying
there's been some noise about Cloudbot
gateways being exposed on the internet.
He investigated. Here's what he actually
found. He says he pulled all Cloudbot
instances from Shodan, 450 gateways
discovered via MDNS and scanned them for
missing authentication. The results:
there were zero that were vulnerable.
Zero vulnerable instances in the wild.
The 10 publicly accessible gateways all
properly configured with auth tokens. The
other 429 aren't even reachable. They're
bound to localhost as intended. He's
got the full code and report available
on GitHub. But it's important to
understand that these are still
vulnerable to prompt injections as the
creator even said himself in that intro
clip that we saw. Somebody at
some point is going to get prompt
injected. That's just the nature of
how these things work. We have not found
a foolproof system to defend against
it. So kind of watch out for that.
Somebody's going to get burned. There's
a lot of liability here. That's why the
AI labs don't want to be doing this.
They don't want to be exposed to
something like this. That's why it's
open source. It's kind of at your own
risk. And overall, I think it's going to
move everything forward. It's going to
help us figure out how to protect
ourselves, etc. But there's going to be
a few broken eggs, if you will. There's
going to be probably some people that
are going to lose out as a result of
this. This is very experimental
area we're entering. All right, so let's
talk about how to set this up really
fast. It's a little bit
complicated, especially if you're
setting up all the skills and all
this other stuff that you need. But as
always, AI is your friend. Use your
favorite chatbot, ask it questions, have
it walk you through it. If you haven't
done stuff like this before, expect to
spend some time on it, maybe even come
back a few times. I was not able to run
it on Windows, so I dusted off my
MacBook. It's the best experience on
MacBook. It runs natively. You're going
to need some model, some AI model. I
used Anthropic, but you can use OpenAI
or whichever one you want. I'm sure you
can connect whatever you want to it. I
only recall seeing OpenAI and Anthropic.
I'm sure they have all the other models
on there as well. And then you need as
they say here the "mouth." So some sort of
a messaging platform. You can use
Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp or Slack. So
I've tried hooking up every single one
of these. Discord requires a developer
portal setup. So you set up a new
Discord, create a bot. You give it some
permissions. It can be a little bit
difficult again if you're not a
developer. If you're a developer, if
you're 10,000 hours, most of this will
be fairly easy. But for the average
person, Discord will be somewhat
difficult. Maybe the same thing with
Slack. I haven't used the Telegram too
much. I did have a WhatsApp just because
I have to message some people that are
only on WhatsApp. That was the easiest
one from a technical perspective. If you
just want to get up and running, that
one's super easy because ClawdBot just shows
you a QR code. You go into your
WhatsApp, then you click on the QR
camera button, whatever. You just hold
it up and then you say link this device.
It's part of linked devices and then
you're pretty much done. If you ever
forget how to install it, you can
actually go to clawd.bot
and it actually has the quick start
installation here for you. So you just
need to remember this basically. So on
your Mac device, just pull up Terminal
and just open up Terminal. Then just
type in the command to install it.
Again, use one of your favorite chatbots
if that helps if you're not familiar
with this stuff. All right, so just I
wrote it in there and away it goes. I
already installed mine, so how yours
appears might be different. It just told
me I've evolved. Try to keep up. And
then the lobster thing. Okay, good. Good
job, Cloudbot. If you want to double
check everything is running fine just
type in cloudbot version. So I'll put
that in there.
Let's see. Pro tip, you have to spell
things correctly. You're welcome. There
it is. So that's the version that we're
running. And then run claudebot onboard.
By the way, I'll just post this
down into description or I'll leave a
link to a website that is going to
have this. I'll just post it on my blog
so that you have the updated commands if
needed. But this is what you would do
right now. Cloudbot onboard. So type
that in and that's going to walk you
through that initial onboarding
process. So first and foremost it gives
you a security notice. It's saying
understand this is powerful and
inherently risky. Right? So you'll have
to select yes to continue. You can do a
quick start or manual. So let's start
with the quick start. Again I already
used it. So some of this stuff I already
have it in there. So first and foremost
the model provider. We have OpenAI, Anthropic,
Minimax, Qwen, Synthetic, Venice, Google,
Copilot, Open Router, Moonshot, etc. So I
went with Anthropic. I think most people
will go with Anthropic just because of
how powerful Claude Opus 4.5 is. But
whatever you select, you know, you can
always come back and add more models
later. You are going to need the API key
from Anthropic's website. So get that and
put that in there. After you put that
in, you're going to see all the models
that that provider has. Likely what you
want, by default, it should have a good
one selected for you. So if you're using
Anthropic, you'll have Claude Opus 4.5.
So keep current should work well. This
is where some people might run into some
issues. So Telegram is great. I think
that's the one it sort of recommends you
do. WhatsApp just uses a QR link. Again,
if you just want to get in there and get going,
that might be technically the easiest
thing to get started. I've tried
Discord. You have to go into their
developer portal. You do have to create
a new bot. You have to give that
bot permissions. Then you got to give,
you know, the secret code to
ClawdBot. Google Chat didn't work for
me yet. Slack works, but again, there's
some back and forth API stuff like
that. And I haven't tried anything else
yet. So again, the suggested one is
Telegram and WhatsApp is just the
easiest, the fastest because it's just a QR
code. Configure skills now. So these are
all the skills that you can attach. So
they're saying preferred node manager
for skill installs. So npm is probably
the most common, I would guess, bun.
People say it's really good, but if you
have the technical knowledge for it, so
I don't know, maybe just hit npm unless
you know what you like and prefer
something. Next is install missing skill
dependencies. So you have 1Password,
Apple Notes in here. You have Google
Places as well, Nano Banana Pro. So you
can get up and running without any of
these. So you can go hit space to select
skip for now and then just hit enter.
But obviously this unlocks a lot of use
cases. So at some point do think about
setting those up. Enable hooks. So, what
I did here, I actually asked Gemini
3 what it would recommend. It said
just select all three of them and then
go. So, I'm trying that for now.
We'll see how well that's working and
let me know if you have any better
ideas. Leave it in the comments if you
think that's foolish, but that's
what I've started with. And so, I
already did it. So, it's asking me, do I
want to restart? I'll just say skip. And
it's saying, how do you want to hatch
your bot? Like, where do you want it to
appear? Do you want to hatch it in TUI?
That's the recommended, or the web UI. So
if you do TUI then it just opens up like
this right and it says hey what's going
on? So it's basically this kind of
command line interface within a web
environment where you can go back and
forth with it, a chatbot interface
rather, and boom you're pretty much done
at least with the setup. There's tons
more things that you can add that you
can integrate with but that gives you
kind of the basics that you need to
get started. So now you can message it
through that TUI, that kind of a
website that it opened up for you, or on
your phone if you set up WhatsApp or
Messenger or Slack or whatever you did
there. You can also start messaging it
there and chances are during the process
something's going to fail, something's
not going to work right. So again, ask
your favorite chatbot. It can walk you
through it pretty well. I've used Gemini
3 to walk me through it and it does a
very good job of explaining
everything and walking me through step
by step how to install this thing. So I
kind of love this little meme, this
clip that they've made. Me as a child
commanding pixel armies. Me now,
commanding AI agents, similar to
Warcraft and Starcraft, Factorio, etc.
Home World. That was a good one.
Anyways, I'll leave some links down
below. Get involved. Start using this.
This is getting real. Obviously,
be careful your security. Be aware of
the various attack vectors. Think about
what can ClawdBot screw up for you if
you know it does something wrong. And
also your security. Can there be
a prompt injection that happens somehow?
Just be aware of the security.
We're kind of in the wild wild west era,
so it's exciting, but also, you
know, somewhat dangerous. So, I'm in the
process of messing around with this
thing. I'll have more videos, more
follow-ups later. Let me know what you
think and I'll see you in the next one.
