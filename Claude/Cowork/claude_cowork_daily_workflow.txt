Claude Co-work is going to be the
biggest AI tool of 2026 and you're not
even using 1% of its ability. I
discovered a new workflow with Claude
Co-work I promise you've never seen
before. I type in just three words every
morning and it kicks off a workflow that
saves me hours a day. If you stick
around to the end of this video, you're
going to get prompts for clawed co-work
that will make you more productive than
you ever have been before in your entire
life. Let's get into it. So, here's all
I need to type into Claude Co-work to
get it to do an enormous amount of work
for me automatically. If you haven't
used Claude Co-work yet, it's basically
Claude code for your entire life. It
takes the AI agent that Anthropic built,
which is by far the most powerful AI
agent on the entire market and allows
you not to only just write code with it,
but also manipulate files on your
computer, do research for you, and do a
tremendous amount of work for you
automatically. Here's the issue that 99%
of people have with Claude Co-work is
they just don't know what to tell it
what to do. People don't really know
what it's capable of and they're not
used to the idea of an AI agent doing
all their daily work for them. So, I
came up with this advanced workflow that
takes out all of that creative thinking.
Instead of having you decide what Claude
Co-work should do for you, it decides
what it should do for you. This is a
workflow literally anyone can use. It
doesn't matter how technical or
untechnical you are, what type of work
you do on a daily basis. What I'm about
to show you will allow Claude Co to give
you value no matter what you do on a
daily basis. So, just to spoil what I'm
going to show Claude Co-work did for me
in this video, all with just those four
words is it scripted this entire video
you're watching right now. It wrote for
me an entire thread for X about the X
algorithm. It wrote me a draft for my
newsletter today. It did research on AI
energy stocks because I want to invest
in AI energy. and it gave me a strategy
for getting to a 100,000 subscribers on
YouTube. All with just me saying, "Hey,
let's start our day." I didn't tell
Claude to do any of these tasks
explicitly. And then after doing those
tasks, it put all that work into this
really structured, organized file system
on my computer. Let me show you how all
of this works. So when I say, "Let's
start our day in Claude Co-work every
morning." I do this every single
morning. Every morning I go into Claude
Co-work and I say, "Let's start our
day." What I'm doing is I'm including
two things. And I will have all the
files, prompts, everything you need in
the description below as well. I'm
including a claude.md file, which is a
brand new rules file I made just for
Claude Co-work. And I am including this
new Claude folder, which is a directory
I made on my computer for Claude to work
in. And don't worry, I'll show you how
to set up both of these in a second.
It's super super simple. I hit enter on
this and Claude Co-work gets to work. It
first reads the rules file to understand
what I'm trying to tell it to do. So
it's saying, "Good morning, Alex. I see
you uploaded a claw.md file. Let me take
a quick look to see what's inside.
Inside this claude.md file is all the
rules around how I want claude co-work
to work. So as you can see here, here's
my daily operating system. This will be
your daily operating system after you
watch this video. That basically says
whenever the user says let's start our
day or morning or daily brief or
anything like that, go through this
entire workflow. So let's see what
Claude Co-work has for us here. It's
asking us three questions. It asks us
these same three questions every single
morning. One, what's the number one
thing that I'd make today a win? Two,
what's on your to-do list for today? And
three, any urgent items I should know
about. So, I'm going to say number one,
so this might not seem like much, but
this is actually massive. And the reason
it's massive is this. Instead of making
the relationship between you and AI, you
telling AI what to do, which requires a
lot of your own mental energy, figuring
out what you should do, what the AI
should do, and just having to do a lot
of creative thinking, which most people
don't want to do. It reverses that
relationship, and now the AI is asking,
"Hey, just what are you doing today?"
Now, it's on the AI agent, in this case,
Claude Co-work, to figure out what it
should do best instead of you having to
come up with ideas for it. This saves
you a ton of time. So, let me show you
how this works. So, I'm going to say
number one thing I want to do is film an
excellent YouTube video about my clawed
co-workflow. A little bit meta because
you're watching the video right now.
Number two is I give it my entire to-do
list. So, I need to film that video. I
need to write a thread about the newly
open-sourced X algorithm. I need to work
on my side project. I need to figure out
new functionality for Creator Buddy,
which is my main project. I need to
write a newsletter about how to build
apps and claude code. And I want to find
AI companies to invest in. And I say the
only urgent thing I'm trying to figure
out is how to hit 100,000 subscribers on
YouTube. Hit subscribe down below. I'm
going to hit send on that. And now what
Claude Co-work is going to do is it's
going to look through my entire to-do
list and it's going to figure out which
tasks on my to-do list it can help out
with. I think this solves the biggest
problem most people have with clawed
co-workers. They just don't know what to
do with it. They don't know what task to
give it. They don't know what it's best
at. They don't know what it's skilled
at. And because it requires so much
creative thinking to figure out how to
use it, most people just don't use it.
My guess would be you, the person
watching this video, probably haven't
used Claude Co-work a ton just because
you don't know how to use it and what
tasks it's great at. This solves that
problem. So now, instead of you telling
what Claude Co-work to do, it interviews
you and figures out what it can do. So
it has my entire to-do list. It tells me
how it can help for each and every one
of those tasks. It's going to research
AI energy stocks. It's going to do a
draft for me for my entire newsletter.
It's going to brainstorm features for
Creator Buddy, my AI SAS. It's going to
write my entire X algorithm thread
completely by itself. So, it'll research
the open source algorithm and draft the
thread. And it's going to script this
entire video for me, which is the script
of the video you're watching right now.
And then it even recommends how to do
the work. So, all I have to do is
instead of giving it a bunch of
instructions what to do, all I have to
do is say, "Okay, go ahead." Now, it
says done. saved to our outbox. Inside
our folder. So, a little preview of how
this entire system is working behind the
scenes. We have this clawed folder I
created, which I'm going to give you a
prompt at the end of this video that
creates this entire file system for you.
It has an outbox folder. In this outbox
folder, it actually has all the outputs
of what Claude Co-work is making for
you. So, it's nice and organized. It has
a context folder which has a bunch of
markdown files that describes me, what
stocks and assets are inside my
portfolio, what my schedule is like,
what projects I'm working on, and then
it has this claude.md file, which is
basically the rules file for me. And in
this rules file, it describes exactly
how this workflow works. When I say,
"Let's start our day. Ask me these
questions." Then take a look at all the
context inside this clawed folder, then
start asking me questions based on my
day. So right now it went through all of
that and actually wrote me the script
for this video. So I said, "Okay, start
the other task." And now it is going
through and it's actually spinning up
three sub agents that are now
researching the X algorithm. We can see
the steps on that. It's actually going
through and searching through X and
going on GitHub to look at the
algorithm. As you can see, it has gone
through like a hundred different
websites to research this algorithm. And
now it is writing the file that is the
thread for my algorithm. It's
researching AI energy stocks. So, it's
going through all the AI energy stocks
that are on the market. It's looking at
a ton of different websites. And again,
I didn't have to come up with all these
tasks for Claude Co-work to do. It
figured out what to do based on my to-do
list for today. It wrote the file and
then now it's drafting a strategy to
reach 100,000 subscribers on YouTube.
And so now it created this entire
strategy. It's going through different
YouTube strategies, different YouTube
thumbnail designs. Look at all these
websites. It went through simultaneously
as the other tasks and then it wrote
that file. Let's see the output of all
this. So boom, here's our outbox. Here's
our three new files. They all finished
within 2 minutes of each other. Let's
take a look first at the X algorithm
thread. Boom. There's an entire thread
about how the X algorithm works. It has
10 tweets in it. AI energy stocks. So
boom, here's all the AI energy stocks it
researched. Key catalyst growth
profiles. You can see each one of the
companies here. And then my 100,000
subscriber YouTube strategy. Let me pull
this up here. Here's my entire strategy.
So, it actually found my YouTube channel
and it's going through and gave me. Wow,
look at this. Look at all this strategy
it wrote for me. And this all took like
2 minutes. It basically completed 80% of
my work for the day in like 3 minutes.
That's hours saved. And this all stemmed
from this very organized yet sort of
complex folder system we set up that
includes all the context about who we
are, what we do, and how we want Claude
Co-work to work with us. This Claude MD
file, which I will give to you link down
below in the description, is basically
the brain behind this entire operation
that tells Claude Co-work exactly how to
work with us. So, all I need to do is
type in let's start our day and it
starts doing hours of work
automatically. I truly believe this is
the most powerful complex clawed
co-work system anyone in the world is
doing right now. And if you set this up,
you will be more powerful than 99.9% of
your competition. But how do you set
this up? Very simple. You just need this
folder system set up. And the easiest
way to get this folder system set up is
by using the prompt I'm about to show
you here. So, I'll include a link to
this prompt in the description, so you
can just copy and paste and get this
entire thing set up, but this daily OS
starter prompt will guide Claude on
exactly the folder structure it needs to
create. So, what you're going to want to
do to start this is you want to go in
create a new Claude folder. I did this
right in my documents on Mac. Just
create Claude. Then you go in, you click
new task in Claude Co-work, which is the
Mac desktop app. So you go to Mac
desktop app, click co-work here, new
task. Then make sure you select this
folder. So you select claude in there.
So there it is. That's selected. Then
you just paste in this prompt. And this
prompt will instruct it on creating the
context folder, the inbox folder. So you
can see inbox here. Inbox is going to be
the folder you place any files you want
Claude Co-work to see before it does any
tasks. So for instance, if I wanted to
review a script I just wrote, I will put
the script in the inbox. Then you also
have the outbox folder which is for all
the output from Claude. So anything
Claude creates or changes or edits for
you, it will automatically put in the
outbox folder because that's what's in
our claude.md rules. There's the context
folder which has your profile,
portfolio, schedule, and projects files.
So as you can see here, here's my
profile. Just talks about a little who I
am, what my goals are, what my
preferences are. It has my portfolio
which has all the details about all my
stocks and investments and a whole other
information about all the projects I'm
working on. This gives Claude Co-work
tons of context. So, as it's doing tasks
for you proactively, it knows all about
you and it can figure out how to be the
most helpful. There's also a skills
folder which there's no skills system
for Claude Co-work at the moment. So, I
just built the skills system myself
which has markdown files that describes
how to do any skill we want Claude
Co-work to do. Now, I'm sure a lot of
this will soon be built into Claude
Co-work. So, for instance, the claude.md
file, like they'll probably make a
claude.md rule system for Claude Co-work
specifically soon, and they will
probably have a skills folder for Claude
Co-work specifically soon. But that
doesn't impact this at all. You can
still get ahead of the curve by creating
these now and then when Claude Co-work
eventually comes out with the skills
system and the claude.md system, you can
just copy and paste your files over to
that new system. So all you want to do
is copy and paste this prompt I linked
down in the description. Put in Claude
Co-work. It will set up this entire
folder system for you and then all you
need to do every single day. This is the
only thing you need to remember to do is
come in say let's start our day. Click
and drag in your claude.md file, which
is all your rules and basically the
brain of this entire operation, and
Claude Co-work will automatically get to
work for you and save you hours a day.
There's a lot more to this as well. In
the Claude rules file, there's an end of
the day routine. So, at the end of the
day, you can say end of day, and it will
go in and summarize what you got done,
give you a list of everything it
completed, suggest priorities for
tomorrow. So, there's a lot you can do
for this, and it's completely
customizable, too. So, if you want to
change how it works, anything it does,
you can go into this claude.md file and
change it yourself. This is the brain
and it's fully editable, completely by
you. I will include two Google Docs in
the description. One is going to be the
prompt to set all of this up. The other
is going to be my entire claude.md file
that you can just copy and paste into
your own just in case the original
prompt doesn't write this entire thing
in detail. If you take both of those,
you will have the same Claude co-work
system set up that I have set up and I
promise you it will save hours of time.
I started a whole community around
