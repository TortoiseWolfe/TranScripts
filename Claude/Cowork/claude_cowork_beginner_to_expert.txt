Wow, it actually did all that research
and created this amazing document. That
is incredible. Anthropic just released
Claude Co-work and it might just be the
most powerful AI tool of all time. It's
like Claude Code except it's an AI
employee that works for you 24/7 doing
anything you want on your computer. I'm
about to show you several use cases that
will save you time, save you money, and
make you more productive than you ever
have been before. In this video, I'll go
over what Claude Co-work is, how to use
it, even if you've never used anything
like it before, and show you some use
cases that you can use immediately to
get amazing value out of it. Let's lock
in and get into it. So, this is Claude
Co-work, and it can do some absolutely
amazing things. But right before we get
into the demo, I want to talk about what
it is, how it works, and what makes it
different than Claude and Claude Code.
There are some major differences here
between Claude Co-work, Claude Code, and
just regular Claude. The main thing you
need to know, and you can pause here and
look at this if you want, but the main
thing you need to know is Claude Co-work
is basically an employee that controls
your computer and can output anything
you need, documents, slideshows, code.
It can create things. It can research
for you. It does everything. It
basically takes the best of just regular
Claude, like if you just go to claude.ai
and Claude Code which builds you apps
and writes you code. It takes the best
of both of those and puts it into one
app. It's basically Claude Code but for
regular people, right? Claude Code
writes you code and basically does
anything you need that is code related.
Co-work is the same thing except it not
only works on code, it builds you
anything you need at all. So it is your
24/7 employee while Claude is a
researcher that does research for you.
Claude code is a developer that writes
code for you. Claude co-work does
everything. Research, write code,
execute code, create files, whatever you
need, it does it. And the coolest part
about all this, I think the biggest
differentiator between Claude Code and
Claude is it controls everything. So it
can control your computer, it can
manipulate documents, it can control
your browser, it has its own virtual
environment where it will do things on
its own. It literally is as if you hired
someone and they had their own computer
and did whatever you needed. So there's
a lot here. You can pause if you need
to, but the main thing you need to know
is Claude co-work takes the capabilities
of Claude code but applies it to all the
use cases you can think of. It's claude
code but for everything and that is a
big game changer and let me show you
why. So claude cowork is available in
the Claude desktop app on Mac only at
the moment. So you download the Claude
desktop app and you now have this new
tab here for co-work. Click on that.
You're in co-work. You do need to be on
a max plan. So, either the $100 or $200
plan to get this working. Although,
there is currently a wait list for the
$20 plan as well, so that you can use it
on the cheaper tier. Here is what the
interface of Claude Co-work looks like.
Very, very simple. You have your basic
chat. Gives you some examples of what it
can do. So, it can build and create apps
just like Claude Code, but it can also
do other things like create files for
you, organize your computer, create
documents, slideshows, send messages,
send emails, control your browser, do
research, whatever you need, it can do
it. So, I have four use cases I'm going
to show you. All four of these you
should be able to use the moment this
video ends and get incredible value out
of it. But, let's start with a really
simple one. I'm sure this is one
everyone watching the video can use, and
that is organizing the files on your
computer. So, let's real quick go into
this. We have the option of choosing a
specific folder we want Claude to work
out of. If you're anything like me, your
computer is absolutely littered with
images, screenshots, thumbnails. Like
you can see that this is my downloads
folder and literally the first 15 files
are images and screenshots. Let's have
Claude organize this for us. This is an
absolute mess. If you had me go back
right now to try to find a specific
image, no way I'd be able to do it. So,
let's open the downloads folder. And
let's say this, and I'll put this prompt
down below if you want to steal it. So,
I'm going to say go into that downloads
folder, take all the images and
screenshots, and put them into a new
images folder. Organize that images
folder any way you want. And I'm going
to say, let's go. And now, our agent is
going to spin up, go into that folder on
our local computer, and actually go
through, look at every file in that
downloads folder. I've had this computer
forever, so there's probably thousands
of files in that folder. And actually
organize it. take all the images, put
them in a separate folder and organize
our computer for us. So, as you can see
here, there are a lot of files. Let me
look at all the images. Found 369 image
files. Now, it's creating its own folder
and organizing everything. What's really
cool here, as you can see on the right
hand side, it keeps a to-do list. This
is what makes it very agentic, is it
figures out a to-do list, it tracks its
progress against that to-do list, and
it's constantly reflecting to make sure
it's on task and doing what we need. So
over on the right you can see its to-do
list. You can see any artifacts it
creates. So if it creates any documents,
slideshows, anything, we can see that
here. And we can see the context. So
it's working out of our downloads
folder. And you can kind of imagine the
workflow as we get into this right now,
which is you wake up in the morning, you
have your list of tasks you want to give
your 24/7 AI employee. You give it to
Claude Co-work. It gets to work. It
tracks all the progress to-do list. You
come back an hour later and absolutely
everything's done for you. This is
really a whole new paradigm of working
with AI, which is incredible. So, it's
taking a look at all the images. It's
actually opening up the images
themselves, seeing what they are, and
then putting them into meaningful
subfolders inside our downloads folder.
It's basically having a cleaning lady in
my computer just organizing it for me,
which is pretty amazing. Done. I've
organized 370 images from your downloads
folder into this new image folder with
10 subfolders. Wow. duplicates,
thumbnails, photos, miscellaneous, web
downloads, AI generated, design
projects, logos, screenshots, GIFs. If
this worked, that would actually be
incredible. Okay. We have our images
folder here now in downloads. Let's open
that up. There's all our subfolders.
Let's see. Let's look at our thumbnails.
It's going to have all my YouTube
thumbnails in it. Yep, there's all my
YouTube thumbnails. Let's open this up
to make sure. Yep, there it is. That is
incredible. Our entire downloads folder
is now organized. But that's just table
stakes. Let's get into the second use
case, which gets a lot more interesting.
So, I'm going to go into a new task
here. Let's spin up a new AI employee to
work for us here. So, if you're anything
like me, maybe you're an internet
entrepreneur, maybe you have a couple
different content channels that you
create. Maybe you're on Twitter, maybe
you're on YouTube, maybe you're on X,
and maybe you're just getting started
and you're thinking about potentially
getting sponsors. Well, one thing that's
very important if you're trying to get
sponsors or make money online is you
have some sort of media kit, whether
it's a presentation or slideshow that
just explains what you do, what you talk
about, and who you're about. This is a
great use case for Claude Co-work. So,
here's the prompt. I have a newsletter
with 40,000 subs called Ship It Weekly.
Please go to my newsletter site,
alexfinn.ai, and research it. then make
a media kit presentation for me that I
can send to potential sponsors. This is
another amazing use case for Claude
Co-work because building this
presentation probably would have taken
hours before and require amazing taste
and design skills. This is something I
can spend 10 seconds writing this
prompt, send it to Claude Co-work, go
off and do something else, come back a
few minutes later and have all the work
done for me. Hours saved just like that.
I'm going to hit enter and it is going
to get to work for us. This is also
going to demonstrate a lot of the really
amazing capabilities of Claude Co-work.
It's showing you all the tools it's
using over here. So, it is using the web
search connector. So, it is going
online. It's using its own tool to
search the web and get current
information. If you just go to claude.ai
and say, "Hey, build this for me." This
wouldn't work because Claude doesn't
have access to current information on
the web. Claude Co-work though actually
has direct live up-to-the-moment
information about what's going on the
web. If I sent a newsletter five seconds
ago, it would have access to that.
Claude.ai wouldn't. So that's a really
big strength of this tool. Another
amazing thing here is it uses Claude
skills. So it takes its entire skill
system from Claude code and integrates
it into here. So if you have specific
skills or instructions for things you
want your AI employee to do, you can
create your own claude skills file that
it will use. So it's setting up the
presentation. It's going to create all
the slides for the media kit. It's going
to generate the PowerPoint file and it's
going to validate it. That's amazing.
Let's see what we got here. Ship it
weekly media kit 2026. AI made simple.
So, got the catchphrase from my website.
That's amazing. About Ship It Weekly.
Weekly beginner friendly guides on how
to improve your life with AI. That's
accurate. Newsletter highlights, AI
tutorials, one to two emails per week.
It's on Substack premium tier. By the
numbers, 40K subscribers, 45% open rate,
8% click-through. Sponsorship options.
It even came up with the tiers for the
sponsorships. That's pretty amazing. And
then let's work together. Wow. Pulled my
email. All that is fully done. I can now
take this and send this off to potential
sponsors. That's like literally two
hours saved just like that. Anytime you
have presentations, documents you need
to create, this is the way I do it. I
have two more use cases I want to show
you. One is financial tax season's
coming up. So, I'm going to show you
something a little more financial
related. And then I'm going to show you
one around building apps. So what I just
did here is I dropped in a statement
from last year for my credit card. And
what I want to do is have Claude Co-work
go into a credit statement, look at all
our purchases, all our subscriptions,
and then make a spreadsheet of all our
subscriptions for us, and then guide us
on unsubscribing from those
subscriptions so we can save money. Go
through my credit statements and make a
spreadsheet of all the subscriptions I
have. Then make a column for the cost of
the subscription and a column that
explains how to unsubscribe. Let me know
how much I'd save by unsubscribing to
everything. And I'm going to say, let's
go. Boom. Took me literally 10 seconds
to drag those in and put that prompt. It
already found all the subscriptions. I'm
spending $16,000 a year on
subscriptions. Holy hell. It made a
spreadsheet with monthly cost and how to
unsubscribe from each. That literally
took 3 minutes tops, we're already
saving thousands of dollars a month.
And the last prompt and use case is one
for the vibe coders. That is a project
research prompt where Claude Co-work
will go in, research an app idea you
give it, judge the idea, validate the
idea, find competitors, give you a
report on the competitors, write you an
entire PRD that shows you users you're
going to target, the MVP you should
build, a prompt for Claude Code. It's
going to search for domains that are
available, everything. I have an idea.
3D AI agent manager like a RTS game. Run
it through full validation. Research
competitors, analyze the market,
identify strengths and weaknesses, then
create a professional PRD document with
charts and tables that include target
user, core user loop, MVP scope, tech
stack, timeline, naming, domain
suggestions, launch strategy, and claude
code starter prompt. The agent goes, it
searches the web, does research, finds
live information, and puts together an
entire report. Full market analysis.
Competitive landscape. SWOT analysis.
Targeted user. Core features for the MVP
and the entire tech stack. Claude Code
starter prompt. I can just take this
prompt, give it to Claude Code, and
it'll start building the app. It's a
14-page PRD. Here's how you get good
with this tool: challenge yourself.
Every day this week for 10 minutes. Go
in, use the app, brainstorm things you
can do. If you don't know what to do
with co-work, say, "Hey, this is my day.
How can you help with this?" Send that
in. And then just for 10 minutes a day,
spin up tasks in co-work. Come back
later and see what it did. If you do
this for a full week, I promise you'll
be really good at using this tool.
