Working on legacy code bases is proving
to be one of the harder challenges in AI
powered development in 2026. Your agents
can read every file in your project, but
they don't understand why you built
things the way that you did. The
reasoning behind your conventions, the
patterns that your team refined over the
years, the architectural decisions that
shape everything. None of that comes
through when an agent scans your code.
So, every time you prompt, you're
reexplaining, you're reteaching, you're
reestablishing context that should
already be baked in. I created Agent OS
to fill that gap. It's a lightweight
system for defining and managing your
coding standards in AI powered
development. And today I'm releasing
version three. It's stripped down by 70%
yet it's more useful than ever for how
we actually build here in 2026. Now, if
you saw my last video on the channel
where I said cloud code is all you need,
I also promised a follow-up showing what
I actually want out of a utility
framework. This is that video. The
philosophy behind version 3 of Agent OS
is simple. Don't reinvent what the core
tools already do well. Strip away
everything that overlaps with Cloud
Code's native features and keep only
what fills the gaps that professionals
and teams actually care about. Now, if
you're new to the channel, I'm Brian
Castle. I help professional builders
stay ahead of the curve with AI first
development. And every Friday, I send my
builder briefing. That's a free 5 minute
read. No hype, just my take on this
transition into building with AI. You
can get my next one by going to
buildermethods.com. Now, agent OS has
always been built around spec driven
development. The idea that we should
plan before we build, shape the work
first, and then let agents execute. So,
when I first released Agent OS back in
mid 2025, the tooling wasn't quite there
yet. So, I created Agent OS to build in
scaffolding for writing specs and
breaking them into task lists and
orchestrating implementation. But since
then, cloud code and cursor and others
have evolved significantly. Plan mode is
now a first class feature and today's
frontier models are dramatically better
at maintaining context and executing
complex multi-step plans without losing
the thread. So the question became what
does agent OS actually need to do now if
anything? The answer is it should fill
the gaps that vanilla cloud code doesn't
address without stepping on the features
that it already handles well. So in the
new agent OS version 3 I reduced its
footprint by 70% and in doing so made it
significantly more useful. So let me
explain what stayed and what's new. So
agent OS was always built on the idea
that you define your standards first.
You know your conventions for how you
build things like our API responses use
this structure or our components follow
this naming convention. Standards are
kind of similar to what you might put in
your claw.md file, but agent OS gives
you a system to inject only what's
relevant and not load everything into
context every time. What's new in V3 is
that Agent OS now discovers and writes
your standards for you. So, you can run
a command, point it at an area of your
codebase, and it analyzes what's there,
looking for patterns that are unusual or
opinionated, you know, things that a new
developer or an agent wouldn't know
without being told. So, it interviews
you with targeted questions to capture
your reasoning behind what it found.
This is knowledge that used to exist in
between the lines of your code or in
your head, but now formalized and
accessible in a way that your agents can
actually use. Second, Agent OS gives you
enhanced spec shaping. So, plan mode is
now the industry standard for spec
driven development and is built right
into cloud code and cursor and most
major tools. So, Agent OS enhances that
by helping you shape your specs with
targeted questions that take your
standards and your product's mission
into account. Agent OS also saves your
plans into persistent spec folders,
something that cloud code doesn't do by
default. Third is profiles. So this lets
you maintain different sets of standards
for different project types. So maybe
you have a Laravel profile and a
marketing site profile and an internal
tools profile. Set them up once and then
choose the right one when you're
starting up a new project. And Agent OS
version 3 gives you a new way to sync
your standards from your current project
into a profile so that you can port them
into other projects later. Okay, let me
show you what this looks like in
practice. So, I'm going to use my
buildermethods.com codebase for the
demos that I'm going to show here. And
this is a Rails application including
the front end as well as like the
members area for builder methods pro,
the videos library, our workshops. So,
I've been working on this site and the
backend app for a while now, and it's a
somewhat legacy codebase with with some
established patterns that are just
starting to be formally documented. So,
it's a perfect candidate for agent OS.
Now, I have already installed agent OS
on my system by following the
installation instructions. You know,
first you would clone the repo to your
home directory on your system. That's
your base installation. And then you
would install agent OS into each
individual project by using our project
install script. So I have already done
that in my builder methods project here.
And so that put this agent OS folder
into the project. And inside that we've
got a product folder. I've already run
the agent OS plan product command which
helped me establish my product mission
the road map and the tech stack through
this codebase. It also has a specs
folder. So, I've been using previous
versions of Agent OS to create these
specs. And I'm going to continue using
that specs folder as I move forward now
with Agent OS version 3. And then we
have the standards folder. And this is
where we document our conventions and
the knowledge behind our codebase. And
so I've already done that here in the
builder methods codebase. And so I have
this folder in there called agent OS.
And inside that I've got a product
folder. So this was generated when I ran
the agent OS plan product command that
helped me establish the mission for the
product, the road map and the text stack
for this codebase. And I have some specs
from the previous versions of Agent OS
in there. I can continue to use this
specs folder going forward. And I have
the standards folder. This is where I'm
documenting those conventions and the
knowledge behind my project. Now, if
you've just installed Agent OS into a
project for the first time, the first
thing that you'll probably want to do is
run the plan product command. Now, I've
already done that here, but again, that
will establish your product's mission
and road map and tech stack. But the
other thing that you'll want to do early
and often throughout the life cycle of
your project is discovering and
documenting new standards from your
codebase. Now I'm going to do this in
cloud code but you can do this in any
agent cursor agent or any of the modern
tools these days. So I'm going to start
by running discover standards command.
And so what this is going to do is it's
going to look around my codebase and
start to identify some big focus areas
that we can then dive into and look for
some unique patterns that might be worth
documenting. So here it found a few big
focus areas like you know controllers,
models, views and components. I could go
with one of those or I can direct it
toward a specific area of my codebase.
Now I actually do want to create some
standards around the views and
components. That's something that I have
not yet documented in my standard. So
I'm going to go ahead and go with that
option. Throughout agent OS now, we're
using the ask user question tool, which
is built into cloud code, which gives us
that really nice Q&A interface to ask us
these questions and proceed with these
workflows. Now, it's analyzing all of my
views and components, and what it's
specifically looking for are the areas
that appear to be unique or opinionated
and follow a repeatable pattern. Those
are the types of things that we want to
actually document into standards. We
don't necessarily just want to write
standards that teach agents how to code
in a conventional way because agents
already do that. So agent OS is going to
help to find those unique knowledge in
your codebase. All right, so it found
about five unique patterns in my views
and components and all of these sound
pretty accurate to how the codebase is
structured. So you know I could select
individual ones to proceed with but I'm
going to go with the first option which
is yeah let's create standards for all
of them. And so instead of rushing into
documenting these standards and making
some assumptions, the agent is actually
going to interview me to understand the
reasoning behind why things were
designed or architected a certain way.
You know, it's asking me like, what
problem does this particular pattern
solve? And these are really good
strategic and design questions that we
want to bake into the knowledge that's
in our system here. And again, I can use
the suggested answers or I can give a
little bit more color to my reasoning
and design patterns here. So, the way
that it works is it asks one or two
questions about each new standard. Then
it goes ahead and drafts that standard.
And the key here is to keep the
standards really concise. We don't want
to eat up too much of the context window
when we pull them into the context. So,
it's going to show us the draft and then
I can approve it or skip it or give it
some feedback. I'll approve this one.
So, it's going to go ahead and write it
up and save it. And now we're moving
right along into the next standard that
it identified. So, it's going to ask me
a question. And I gave it a quick
confirmation. And now it's going to go
ahead and write it up. Looks good.
Create it. So, I'm going to have it go
through the rest of these now. And this
is a cycle that you can repeat
periodically throughout the life cycle
of your product as it evolves, as the
codebase grows. And you know, especially
after you've added a whole new section
to your codebase, it's probably a good
time to go ahead and discover any new
standards that may have surfaced. Now,
when you get to the end of the process
of discovering and writing up new
standards, Agent OS will index your
standards. And it does that inside your
standards folder, you have an
index.yaml file. So, this is a list of
each of the individual standards files
within the folder that they live in. And
each standards file gets a one-line
simple description. And so the reason we
do it this way, of course, is so that
the agent doesn't need to read the
entire contents of every single standard
file, which would read all of that
content into the context window every
single time. This enables it to identify
which standards are available just by
reading these descriptions. And then it
lets you choose or it will suggest
standards to inject. This is very
similar to the way that Claude skills
work. Skills also are not read into the
context by default and the agent can
identify the skills based on their
descriptions. In fact, agent OS can also
help you surface available skills to
inject along with your agent OS
standards. So real quick, you know, like
the difference between a cloud skill and
an agent OS standard. A skill is more of
a process-oriented task that you want to
invoke and then run the same way every
time. Whereas the standards that you
would document with agent OS are again,
you know, conventions and best practices
and your opinions and your design
patterns that it might use and apply in
different ways depending on the task.
So, I'm going to finish up that last
process of indexing those new standards
that we've just added to our list. And
by the way, if you ever need to just
index your list of standards, like if
you've added some manually or something
like that, you can always use the index
standards command. That's another tool
that's available inside cloud code. And
so, now that we have a pretty good set
of standards all documented and set up
in my agent OS folder in this codebase,
let's actually use them. And what's
really nice about Agent OS version 3 is
that you can use and inject your
standards anywhere, anytime. You can
inject them when you're just prompting
in a conversation. You can just run
inject standards there. Or you can
inject standards when you're planning a
spec, and I'll show you that in a
minute. Or if you're using Claude to
create a new Claude skill. In fact,
let's go ahead and create a new Claude
skill. I want to create one that will
help me create new UI components in my
codebase. And I'm going to inject my
agent OS standards into the makeup of
that skill. So here we go. First, I'm
going to use the skill creator skill
which was created by the cloud team and
I installed that on my system. So I'm
going to use the skill creator. I'm
going to use dictation here. Let's
create a skill for creating new UI
components in our codebase. Okay, so
this is the normal process of you know
starting to create a new skill. Now this
part of the demo is not agent OS. This
you like any cloud code user can do
this. Again we want to be using the core
claude code features and functionalities
in the best way that they are designed
to be used. And now at some point in the
process, it could be during the Q&A
process, you can choose to type
something or I can just hit the escape
key to pause it before we start building
the skill because before we do, I want
to make sure that we are injecting our
agent OS standards. So I'm going to go
ahead and run inject standards. I'll
just tab into that. The first thing it's
going to do is it's going to detect what
are we doing here? It's going to read
the current conversation and here it
identified that we're clearly creating a
skill. And so it's going to ask me how
should these standards be included in
the skill. And there are basically two
options available here. One is we can
reference the standards which means
we're going to add lines in the skill
files with these at references. And the
benefit of that approach is that our
standards can continue to live in our
standards folder and they'll be
referenced by the skill files. So if we
make changes and update our standards
over time, then those will remain up to
date. The other option is we can copy
the contents of those standards directly
into the skill files like kind of like
hardcode it into the skill files.
Depends on the context and your current
needs and what the skill is for. In my
case, in this particular one, I'm going
to go ahead and choose the referencing
option because this is only going to
live within this one codebase and I want
my standards to be documented in a
single place. And so here we go. What
agent OS just did was it's adding this
instruction to the agent that is
creating the skill and that is it's
going to reference this list of
standards. And by the way, agent OS in a
smart way identified exactly which of my
standards from my list of standards that
should be included in this skill. And it
did that by reading through my standards
index file. All right. So, I'm going to
leave the rest of this skill creation
for off camera and we're just going to
move on with the video here. So, a
driving force behind agent OS in its
early days last year and into this year
in 2026 is spec driven development. And
the way that we do spec driven
development now that cloud code is so
good and cursor is so good is we use
plan mode for that. So, I'm going to
demonstrate how I will plan out and spec
out a new feature for builder methods.
So, before I get into that, what are we
actually going to spec out here? So, in
Builder Methods, when Builder Methods
Pro members are logged in, we've got a
few different areas, including our
videos library and the workshops. We
already have some like topic filtering,
but we don't actually have a search
feature. And so the way that I would
start developing this new feature into
my application would be to go into cloud
code and I will enter plan mode with
shift tab until it says plan mode on. So
you know of course I could just proceed
with planning out a spec and having a
conversation with Claude about that and
then having Claude go ahead and write up
the plan and then have it implement the
plan and most of the time that would be
just fine. But we do have agent OS so we
want to make sure that we will inject
our standards and we want to make sure
that we are shaping up our plan in the
best possible way and that's one of the
big strengths of agent OS version 3. So
now that I'm in plan mode and this will
only work if I'm in plan mode I can run
shape spec that is going to start the
questions process where the agent is
going to interview me with its
clarifying questions and I'll describe
it. I want to build a search feature.
So, I think that's a good start.
There's probably a few more details that
I'll want to work into the plan here,
but that'll be enough to get the process
started. So, it's going to ask some
clarifying questions to really target
and enhance our specs before we go and
actually write them up into plans. And
so, here's one of those questions that
is powered by Agent OS. It's going to
ask me if I have any visuals that I
could reference or mockups or wireframes
or screenshots of similar features. And
normally that's a good idea to add, but
I think I'll just skip them. This is
another one I always like to have the
agent ask when planning a spec, and that
is, are there any similar sections in
this codebase that I should reference?
Here you could see cloud code has taken
upon itself to run three different
agents and one of them is checking for
product context and standards. And it's
looking at agent OS here to see the
product mission, the road map, the tech
stack and the standards that we have.
Okay. So it identified on its own a set
of standards that might apply to this
particular build based on the content
that we've discussed in this shape spec
process. Yeah, I think all four of these
standards do apply. So I'll go ahead and
say yeah, use these. And so it went
ahead and read in those individual
standards so that they will help inform
the plan. So it's going ahead and it's
writing up the spec or the plan if you
will. All right. So Cloud Code has
completed its work of creating the plan
and here's that entire plan. You know it
takes into account all of the standards
including our product mission and
roadmap and everything. So it has that
knowledge baked in. But you'll notice
that there is an interesting task one
added to the very beginning of this
plan. So the first thing that it's going
to do is actually create a spec folder
in the agent OS specs folder. Give it a
date, give it a name, and it's going to
save this plan along with the Q&A
session that we shaped up. So that's the
piece where agent OS will have cloud
code or cursor actually save its plan
into the specs folder in agent OS. Now,
one thing to note is it won't actually
do that while you're still in plan mode.
That's why it added it as the first task
to do before it starts to actually
implement this plan. So I'm going to go
ahead and proceed with this. Yes. And
bypass permissions. And we're going to
see it actually save the plan to the
specs folder. So here we go. That is
task number one. Again, you know, the
building out the tasks from the plan.
That's a core part of spec driven
development that I've been talking about
all throughout last year. Now, that is a
first class feature in cloud code. So we
just leave that sort of thing to cloud
code because it is much better at
tracking its own task list and working
off of its own plan made from plan mode.
And here we go. This folder right here,
it has today's date. And so now it's
going to actually save the planning
documents for this spec into that
folder. Okay, so it's just done that. So
now while it continues with the rest of
this implementation, we can actually see
the spec all documented and saved right
in our specs folder. So let's take a
look at that. So first we have plan.md.
This is essentially the spec, right?
This is the plan. Everything that it
planned out all documented and saved. So
we have that for reference. So it found
some similar patterns in the codebase
that it's going to build this plan
around. Here is shape.md. So this is
like a recap of the early shaping
conversation that I had with cloud code
again powered by agent OS. And then we
do have a standards.md which kind of
lists out exactly which standards we
want to include in the plan. And in this
case we're not referencing the
standards. It just hardcoded them into
the standards md. All right. So it did
finish up implementing the search
features. Let's just check it out. I'm
on the local environment now. So got
some test data here. And here we go. So
here is the search and yeah, it does
filter correctly. Right. So like there's
a few little tweaks that I'll probably
make to the UI. So I'm going to get
those details polished up and then we'll
get this thing shipped. So like I said,
you can inject agent OS standards
anytime, anywhere in your normal
development workflow with cloud code or
with cursor or any other tool. So, I'm
going to show you an example of this. In
a case where we're just doing a small
task, like a small design tweak that
doesn't even warrant building out a
whole spec or a plan, we can still make
use of our agent OS standards in this
situation. So, let me show you. As an
example, I'm going to find something
really small that I want to tweak. Like
on the agent OS page, I'm using this
kind of red brand color here. Then it
goes to these other brand colors down
here. I want to sort of sub-brand agent
OS to use our red color everywhere in a
couple different places. So, I took a
few screenshots of the spots that I want
to tweak that color on. So, in this
case, I'm just going to use a simple
prompt, right? So, I'm just going to get
that started, you know, but before we
get too far along, I just hit escape to
stop it. So, so far we have a little bit
of context in the conversation. You can
stop it and run inject standards. So I'm
going to run that now and let's see how
agent OS behaves in this scenario. So
here like under the hood agent OS knows
that we're just you know in a regular
conversation. We're not creating a
skill. We're not planning out a spec. So
it went ahead and checked our index YAML
to find the list of standards that we
have available and then it picked out
the ones that are most relevant to this
particular task because it sees that we
are trying to do some visual CSS tweaks.
So it found my CSS color standards which
I have in my agent OS standards already.
And so it went ahead and it read that
standards file and then it output its
contents into the context of this
conversation. So now when it proceeds
with making this change, it's going to
take that into account. Now of course
this was a super simple example and but
I wanted to show you the motion that you
can take when you're in a small or even
a long conversation. You can use that
inject standards command anytime you
want to inject your standards and agent
OS will have this system to identify
which standards you want to place in
there. Of course, if you want to just
call out specific standards, you can
simply at reference those in any spot
that you need to as well. So, who is
Agent OS for? Well, if you have a legacy
codebase with undocumented patterns,
Agent OS helps you surface and capture
that knowledge so that agents can
finally understand the why behind your
code. If you're on a team adopting spec
driven development, Agent OS keeps
everyone aligned on standards and
processes. And if you've been
overwhelmed by framework complexity,
Agent OS is lighter than ever. It
doesn't try to replace cloud code. It
fills the gaps that matter. Agent OS is
free and open source. You can get it by
going to buildermethods.com/agent-os
along with all the documentation. And if
you want support, training, and access
to live workshops on building with AI,
that's what builder methods pro. We've
got hundreds of members in there who are
sharing their projects and asking
questions with me and our community of
builders. And one more thing, if you're
starting a brand new project from
scratch where there is no legacy
codebase, where you're building
something from zero, I have another free
open source tool called Design OS along
with a full video walkthrough that's
specifically aimed at rethinking the
design phase when you're architecting a
new product in Cloud Code. So, be sure
to subscribe to the channel so you don't
miss these updates, and I'll see you in
the next video. Let's keep building.
