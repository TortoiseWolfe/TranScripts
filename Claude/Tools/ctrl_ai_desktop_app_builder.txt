Today we are introducing control. Let me
show you. Creating an app starts with a
simple description. I want a habit
tracker with daily check-ins, streaks,
and weekly overview. AI reads my
request, design the database schema, and
writes the entire application. No
templates, real TypeScript code. In
about 2 minutes, I have a working app.
Every app comes with an AI assistant
built in. But here is what different.
The AI has direct access to your app's
database. I can ask it to create three
new habits for me. I suggest entries. I
proof them with one click and they are
instantly saved to my local database. No
manual data entry. Just tell the AI what
you need. This works with any app. Here
is documents one of our default app. We
keep improving. I ask the AI to make
this document more engaging. It analyze
the content and show me precise changes
and as diffs right in the document. I
can accept individual suggestion or
apply everything at once. The AI edits
your actual content, not a copy. Control
ships with a several default apps,
notes, projects, documents, bookmarks.
Switch between light and dark mode
instantly. And every app has AI
assistance one click away. The AI is
always there understanding your data,
ready to help.
Let's look at projects. You get a kanban
board, calendar view, and full task
management. But here is where it gets
interesting. I ask the AI what task am I
missing for our open source launch. The
AI read my existing task, understand
the context and suggest what's missing.
I can add them one by one or all at
once. Each suggestion gets straight into
my database. Here is a weather app I
built with just few prompts. Today I
found a free weather API and wired
everything up. Adding new city is
instant real data real API.
An exercise tracker for my daily routine
built exactly how I want it for the
specific workouts I do. Every app can
have a widget. These show live data from
your app right on your desktop. No need
to open the full app to check your
habits or see today's tasks. Change
wallpapers. Customize your workspace.
This chess app with an AI opponent built
with just five prompts. Full game logic,
move validation, everything. Wordle for
daily puzzle, a stock tracker pulling
live market data from the free API.
Each one built through conversation with
the AI.
Every app has setting you can customize
and importantly you can export any app
as a package and import it anywhere your
apps are logged in. There are real code
you own.
This is where we are heading. Data lake
shows all your data across every app.
Our vision apps that understand each
other. Query your projects and invoices
together. Connect your habits to your
goals. One unified personal data layer.
Most AI coding tools generate code, but
then you are on your own. Figure out
deployments, set up a database, find
hosting. Control is different. It adds a
complete environment where AI builds
apps that just work instantly running on
your desktop with storage, widgets,
everything handled. Try it. Build
something and let us know what you
create.
