In this video, I'm going to show you
exactly how you can turn your Claude Code
terminal session to look something
really plain like this to something like
this where we have the model that we're
using and also shows the progress bar
exactly how much context percentage that
we have used so far and as well as the
current token size that we have consumed
inside of the current context window.
And we can also change the theme of it.
For example, I have changed this to
using the solarized light theme. And you
can be able to change different colors
of it for the status bar you're using
based on your preference. And of course,
you can also include more values like
the versions, the model ID, the current
directories, the project you're using,
and so much more. And the reason why we
do this is because we always want to
stay under a certain context every time
when we interact with Claude Code because
after we exceed a certain threshold for
context window, we usually get a lower
accuracy for the AI generation. And we
have to use the /context command to see
that. And that's why in this video,
I'm going to show you exactly step by
step on how to set this up on your local
machine and how you can be able to
configure this as well as walking you
through an example of using Claude Code
and how we can be able to monitor this
and be able to improve our Claude Code
accuracies using this way to monitor our
Claude context. So pretty much that's
what we're going to cover in this video.
All right, so before we jump in, a quick
intro for those who are new here. My
name is Eric and I have spent years as a
senior software engineer at companies
like Amazon, AWS and Microsoft. And I
have started this YouTube channel to
share everything I have learned along
the way from AI and coding to
automations, web 3, career developments
and more all broken down into practical
tutorials that you can actually follow.
So if you're ready to level up, make
sure to check out my YouTube channel and
hit that subscribe button. Now let's get
back to the video. So to get started,
first thing first, going to navigate to
jq and we're going to install this onto
our local machine for the command line
JSON processor. So I'm just going to
click on download and you can be able to
download this with your Mac OS or Linux
operating system. And what we're going
to do here is I'm just going to click on
download right here. There's actually
give you a command on exactly how we can
install this. So if you have Homebrew
installed on your local machine, you can
simply just use the brew install jq and
basically have this installed. So I'm
just going to navigate to my terminal
here. Here you can see I have a project
open and I'm just going to simply paste
this command to brew install jq. And
once we have this installed, I'm just
going to clear my terminal and I'm just
going to start my Claude session. So here
you can see this is my Claude session.
And what we're going to do here is I'm
just going to use the /statusline command
right here which is the command and then
followed by that command I'm just going
to provide the prompt. First I want to
mention that I'm currently using Mac OS
for the operating system and I would
like to install this globally and please
create a separate .sh file for the
script. So that's basically my prompt
and I'm just going to enter this. All
right. So now you can see that the
status line setup agent here has
configured a global status line with our
Mac OS operating system. So here is what
it creates. So it created the scripts
here which is a bash script that
displays the model name, the current
directory, the git branch as well as the
context remaining and also the output
style. Okay. And basically it has stored
this in the settings for the global
environment. And then to complete the
setup, simply we're just going to run
this command in our terminal and restart
our Claude session. After I run the command
basically in my root directory here, you
can see I'm just going to simply start
my Claude session again. And here you can
see that this is my Claude session,
right? So right here you can see that we
have our status bar right here showing
automatically. So which model we're
using, the context window and also the
amount of tokens that we have consumed
so far. All right. So basically what we
can do now is I can be able to use the
/statusline command here to basically prompt it
and ask what are some options that we can
add onto our status line. So that's
basically my prompt. I'm just going to
ask what are some options that we can
include in our status line and the
/statusline command here is going to fetch
what are the options we can have. Right?
So right here you can see right off the
bat it consumed 23%. So we can actually
be able to verify that it's actually
consumed 23%. And I'm just going to say
currently for the context. So if I were
to type in /context, it should show me
exactly what's the consumption look
like, right? But while it's doing that,
I also want to show you what we have,
right? So for example, we can show the
model, the context for the total tokens,
the context window size. There's also
the session, the workspace, so the
current directory. And here you can see
if I were to do the /context, you can
see that it shows that currently we have
consumed 23% of our context window.
Okay, so total in total we have 200K,
but so far we have consumed 47K. So if I
were to scroll all the way down, you can
see that is accurate based on what we
have, right? So how much we have
consumed 23% as well as how much tokens
we have consumed. But I think this one's
a bit inaccurate because if we were to
scroll all the way up, you can see that
currently we have consumed this much,
right? So we have consumed 23%. So I'm
just going to copy this. And here I'm
just going to say currently you can see
that we have consumed 23% in our status
bar. It shows 23% here in the context
window. But most importantly, you can
see the token here is inaccurate based
on what we see. Can you be able to make
sure that this is aligned with how much
token that we have consumed in the
current context window. So I'm just
going to paste this prompt and pass it
to the /statusline right here. And
hopefully it should be able to fix this.
All right. So now you can see that it
has fully fixed. And here you can see
that this is the percentage that we have
and so far we have used 66K out of 200K
and I also ask it to give the entire
like what are the field values that you
have right? So for example, it has the
total input tokens, the output tokens
and also the entire context window
size which is 200K and also the use
percentage which is 32 which is
what we have displayed here right and
then also we have our input tokens and
then the output tokens. So the actual
context usage here is basically the cache
read input and also the cache creation input
tokens plus the input tokens and the
output tokens which gives you the entire
max of the 32% out of the 200K. Okay. So
basically that gives you a calculation
for how much tokens that we have used.
So you can see here that we get a much
more accurate answer based on this. All
right. So now in this case I'm just
going to open a new terminal and I'm
just going to open another Claude
session. And here you can see that it
has a status line here or status bar
showing inside of our Claude Code
session. All right. So pretty much
that's how you can be able to install
the status bar inside of your Claude
Code. And how can you do this? I
basically wrote up an MD file here.
Simply just pass this MD file to the
Claude Code session and basically have
Claude here to instruct it and follow that
guide to install it, help you to install
it without the pain that we just went
through. Okay. And I'll make sure to put
that doc inside of our community for our
Discord channel which is completely
free. So right now you can see I have
navigated to another computer which is
using VS Code for this particular
project. And I just basically just
referenced this entire path for this MD
file. And I'm just going to say, please
follow this MD file here to set up the
status line bar, which is what I
mentioned inside of this MD file. And
that's basically my prompt to instruct
Claude here to follow the MD file to set
up the status bar. So I'm just going to
send this request and let's have Claude
here to execute this. All right. So now
you can see that Claude has executed
everything that we mentioned inside of
that document. And here you can see at
the end you can see that this is
exactly what we saw inside of the other
computer that we just saw, right? So
right here you can see we have our Opus,
we have the bar, we have how much tokens
we have consumed. So you don't have to
deal with all that. Just pass the
document to Claude Code and let Claude
here to install it based on the instruction
that provided in documentation and have
your status bar ready to go right away.
And just for testing, I'm just going to
stop this terminal session. Clear the
terminal and I'm just going to restart
my Claude session. And right here you can
see we have the bar still present after
we restart our Claude session as well. So
let's say if I want to give it another
prompt and try to see if the status line
here works. So I have started a
terminal session for the application and
this is what the application looks like.
So you can see we have our dashboard
right. So basically this is the
dashboard view and also we have our
transaction and what I noticed that
there's a bug is that currently for the
source file column if we have a
CSV or if we also have a Google Sheets
they actually display the same badge and
what I want to do here is I want to
change the icon for the badge inside of
it to have a different badge for Google
Sheets or the same badge for CSV or
spreadsheet or Excel sheets right so in
this case we want to differentiate
different file types so can you be able
to help me to do that. And that's
basically my prompt. And I'm not going
to change it to a plan mode. And
basically have it to execute. And let's
try to see if the status bar here
changed. Okay. So, right off the bat,
you can see it took 24% of our current
context window. And let's try to see how
much context is actually consuming for
completing this task. Okay, so now you
can see that it has prompted some
questions. So should the CSV and Excel
files share the same color or would you
like them to have different colors? So I
would say same color. So same color for
all of them including spreadsheet, but
it's only the icon here that needs to
change. But CSV, Excel, they can share
with the same icon. And that's my
prompt. And I'm just going to save that.
And you can see that we also have our
progress bar here changed as well as the
amount of token that's changed as well.
And then here you can see it gives me a
plan. So I'm just going to read over the
plan here. So basically differentiate
the file type icon in the source file
column. So change the source file column
in the transaction table to display
distinct icons for Google Sheets versus
CSV and Excel sheets. And here let's
take a look at the current state. Okay.
So this is basically before and after is
that it's going to add another icon. So
if it's Google Sheets, it's going to
change that to the file from
spreadsheets. All right. So in this
case, I'm just going to click on clear
context and bypass permission. So right
here, you can see that it has cleared
context while Claude here is changing the
code. All right. So now you can see that
the Google Sheet has the distinct sheet
icon which is different from other icons
that we have. Right? So these are all
the icon lists that we have here. Okay.
So what I'm going to do here is I'm
going to navigate back to the
application here. You can see this is
the spreadsheet. Okay. That's pretty
good. All right. So now let's say if I
navigate to like CSV data, you can
see this is a completely different
spreadsheet. So I'm just going to take a
picture of this. Come back here. I'm
just going to drag it over here. And
that's going to be image two. And I'm
also going to go all the way here. And
I'm also going to say take a screenshot
of this and take it here. I'm just
going to say currently those two icons
here looks kind of very very similar. Is
there any way that we can differentiate
it? My take here is probably using like
a G or in this case the logo of Google
Sheets, right? Try to use that for an
example or maybe even better like just
use G for Google Sheets or something.
Maybe trigger the front end design skill
here to have a better design. So that's
basically my prompt and let's try to
continue use it and see if the progress
bar here changed. All right. So as the
end result here you can see that it
basically going to remove these four
Claude Code plugins which here you can
see we have our code review, TypeScript
LSP and the code simplifier and also the
feature dev for the Claude settings and
also removing the duplication front
design which is already duplicated. So
it's going to remove that and also here
you can see this is what the Claude
settings look like after it has done. So
it's going to remove this duplication
which should clean up our context window
initially for the prompt. And here you
can see this is the implementation
checklist. So disable the global plugins
and also clean the project plugins. And
then here initially before we have 13
and after that we have nine which saves
about like 8 to 12K for the tokens. So
pretty much that's the plan for
reducing the initial high context for
the context window. So I'm just going to
say continue here and it's going to spin
up a new session here to basically try
to complete this job. All right. So now
you can see that it has removed this
global settings for the four plugins and
it should work now. So I'm just going to
stop my terminal session and basically
start a new Claude session and I'm just
going to say based on the current
uncommitted changes right now can you be
able to commit it with a detailed commit
message and that's my prompt and I'm
just going to submit this and let's see
how much consumption it takes initially.
So currently you can see it takes 23%
which is a lot better compared to before
because before it was like 24 or 25
roughly. You can see this is how we can
be able to clean up our token
consumption initially because the lower
it is the higher accuracy it gets for
the AI right so pretty much that's how
you can use it and benefit from it to
examine the current context window for
the conversation and to see how you can
be able to use that to increase the
accuracy for AI to producing the code
that you want so pretty much that's it
for this video.
