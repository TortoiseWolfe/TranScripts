Hi, welcome to another video. So, Claude
Code just got a pretty significant
upgrade. They're replacing Todos with
something called tasks. And before you
roll your eyes and think, great, another
fancy name for the same thing, let me
tell you why this actually matters.
Tasks are basically the evolution of
Todos, but they solve problems that
Todos never could. Here's the deal.
As Opus 4.5 got better at running
autonomously for longer periods,
Anthropic noticed something interesting.
The Todo Write tool became kind of
unnecessary for smaller tasks.
Claude already knew what it needed to
do. It didn't need a checklist for
simple stuff, but for bigger projects,
for stuff that spans multiple sessions
or involves multiple sub agents,
Todos were completely useless. Think about it.
With Todos, everything lived in memory.
If you closed your session, your todo list
was gone. If you spun up a sub agent, it
had no idea what the main agent was
working on. If you tried to coordinate
work across multiple Claude Code
sessions, you were basically yelling
into the void. Tasks fix all of that.
Now, let me explain what makes tasks
different. First, tasks are stored in
the file system. They live in
~/.claude/tasks.
This means they persist between
sessions. You can close Claude Code, grab a
coffee, come back, and your tasks are
still there.
You can even build your own utilities on
top of them because they're just files.
Second, tasks support dependencies.
With Todos, everything was just a flat
list. Task A, task B, task C. But real
projects don't work like that. Sometimes
task C can't start until task A and task
B are done. Sometimes task D depends on
task C, but task E doesn't. Tasks let
you define these relationships in the
metadata which mirrors how actual
projects work. Third, and this is the
big one, tasks enable collaboration
across sessions and sub agents. When you
spin up multiple sub agents or run
multiple Claude Code sessions, they can
all work on the same task list. When one
session updates a task, that change is
broadcasted to all other sessions
working on the same list.
This is huge for parallelization.
You can have one sub agent working on
the auth system, another on the database
schema, and a third on the tests. They
all see the same task list. They all
know what's been completed and what's
still pending. No more duplicate work.
No more agents stepping on each other's
toes. Now, here's where it gets
interesting. Remember my video on the
Ralph Wiggum loop?
That plugin where you trap Claude Code
in a loop until it actually finishes the
job.
Well, tasks are essentially the official
version of what Ralph was trying to do,
but built directly into Claude Code. Let
me explain. Ralph Wiggum uses a stop hook
to intercept Claude's exit attempts.
Every time Claude tries to stop, the
hook blocks the exit and reinjects the
original prompt. It keeps going until
the task is actually complete. The
problem was Ralph was essentially a
hack, a clever hack, but still a hack.
It didn't have any concept of multiple
tasks, dependencies, or coordination.
Tasks take that same philosophy of keep
going until it's actually done and
integrate it properly into Claude Code's
architecture.
Instead of one task in a loop, you can
have 10 tasks with complex dependencies.
Instead of one session banging its head
against a problem, you can have multiple
sessions and sub agents dividing and
conquering. And the best part, you can
control this with an environment
variable. If you want multiple sessions
to collaborate on the same task list,
you just set CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID
equals whatever name you want and then
start Claude Code.
Sessions using that same ID will see and
update the same tasks. This also works
with claude -p for the CLI mode and with
the agent SDK.
So if you're building automation on top
of Claude Code, you can coordinate work
across multiple instances.
Now let me talk about when you'd
actually use this. For small tasks, you
probably don't need tasks at all. If
you're just asking to refactor a
function or fix a bug, just ask it.
Claude's smart enough now to handle that
without needing a task management
system. But for bigger projects like
building a full feature across multiple
files or doing a large refactor or
creating a test suite,
that's where tasks shine. Here's my
workflow. I'll define my project
requirements, ask Claude to break it
down into tasks with proper
dependencies,
then spin up multiple sub agents to work
on independent branches of the task
tree.
Each sub agent works in its own context
window, but they're all seeing the same
task list. When one finishes a task, the
others see that update and can start
working on tasks that were blocked. This
is the kind of orchestration that used
to require tools like Ralphie, which I
covered in a previous video. Ralphie
added parallel execution, git work
trees, and task dependencies on top of
the Ralph loop, but now tasks handle a
lot of that natively. You still might
want Ralphie for the git work tree
isolation and automatic PR creation, but
the core task coordination
that's built in. Now, I do have a couple
of nitpicks, though. First, the
documentation is pretty sparse right
now. The Claude Code team announced
tasks on X, but there's not much
official documentation yet. I had to
piece together how it works from the
announcement and some experimentation.
Hopefully, they'll add proper docs soon.
Second, I wish there was a visual
interface for tasks. Right now you can
see them in the terminal and you can
Ctrl+T to hide them but a proper
dashboard showing task progress and
dependencies would be really nice.
Maybe someone in the community will
build that.
Third, the fact that you need to set an
environment variable to share tasks
across sessions is a bit clunky.
I'd prefer if there was a slash command
or a config option for this. Something
like /tasks share groceries to start
collaborating on a task list called
groceries,
but these are minor complaints. The core
functionality is solid and it's exactly
what power users have been asking for.
If you've been using the Ralph Wiggum
plugin or Ralphie for autonomous loops,
tasks won't completely replace those.
Ralph is still useful for that
single-minded don't stop until it's done
behavior.
But for coordinating work across
multiple agents and sessions, tasks are
the proper solution. Now, I think this
is the direction AI coding tools should
be going. We're moving from AI as a
helper to AI as a team. And when you
have a team, you need proper project
management. Tasks are Claude Code's
answer to that. Overall, it's pretty
cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below
