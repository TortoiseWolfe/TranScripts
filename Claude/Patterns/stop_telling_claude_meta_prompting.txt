Hello and welcome back to another
episode of Tash Teaches. I'm Tash and in
today's video I want to talk about
something that has massively increased
the effectiveness of my Claude code
usage that we could call meta prompting.
A lot of people who have come to Claude
code have arrived here from using more
kind of ignorant I would say childlike
approaches to AI assisted coding with
platforms like Vzero or Lovable and the
whole vibe coding concept while lovely
in theory of just saying do this do that
make it this works to some extent but
you'll notice that a lot of the time the
things that you want don't actually get
implemented properly or they break or
they can't be effectively tested and you
end up having to give 20 30 individual
prompts to try and solve the singular
problem or add the singular feature that
you wanted to in the first place. So in
order to explain this I want to bring
your focus to this particular prompt
that I tend to run anytime that I want
to do anything of some substance. If I'm
just trying to change the background of
something from yellow to red, sure, I
could do that myself. Go in and adjust
the CSS of whatever it is that I'm
building. Or I could just say make the
background yellow, and that would work
fine. But most of the time, I'm doing
more complex things than that. Things
that require multiple stages of changes
across multiple files and analysis of
certain things, and then ideally
verification and testing to prove that
what I did was right. So, I have this
prompt that I call create prompt. The
reason why we're talking meta prompting
here is very rarely do I tell Claude
what I want it to do and get it to go do
it because most of the time there's
assumptions that it will have or
misalignments with my goals that mean
that by me just saying what I want, it's
not the clearest way for Claude to
understand the instructions that I'm
giving it. So, I've folded this up here
because it's a pretty long prompt that I
run. But this create prompt is a prompt
engineer. We're going to go through this
section by section and then I'm going to
show you in practice how this might be
useful. So, what I would usually do, let
me just whip this up so I could show you
is let's say I open up a new instance of
Claude. Say I want to do a thing.
Instead of saying I want to create a
dashboard blah blah blah blah blah, what
I would first do is do create prompt and
then I tend to use my transcription
tool. So I would say I want to create a
dashboard utilizing blah blah blah blah
blah blah blah blah. For some reason my
transcription tool isn't working. But
the point is it's going to then run this
prompt. You are an expert prompt
engineer for Claude Code specializing in
crafting optimal prompts using XML tag
structuring and best practices. Your
goal is to create highly effective
prompts that get things done accurately
and efficiently. So the first stage is
the user request. The user wants you to
create a prompt for arguments. And this
is whatever comes after this. If I do
create prompt and I say blah blah blah
blah blah blah, this right here is going
to be passed through as an argument to
this custom slash command. So the first
thing it reads is it knows what it is.
It knows what I want to do. Then we have
this core process here. So I've broken
this down that first it uses thinking in
these thinking tags here to analyze what
my request is. So clarity check first
and foremost is it works out whether or
not what I'm asking is clear enough. A
lot of the time it is because usually
I'll just put my transcript on and I'll
say exactly what it is that I want to
do. I'll really wax poetic there. But if
there is not enough context, what it's
going to do is let's scroll down a
little bit here is it's going to ask for
clarification. We'll skip back up again
in a sec. But what happens in that first
step is if it feels that there's not
enough details, it's going to go ahead
and ask me some questions. So, it's
going to ask specific questions about
the ambiguous aspects of my prompt. Blah
blah blah blah blah. As I said, most of
the time I'm giving it enough detail up
front that it doesn't need to do that.
But if I just said build a dashboard,
it's going to want more information. So
let's scroll back up here again for a
sec because you can see that this whole
thinking tag thing, it works out is this
a single file clear goal or is it
complex with multi files? Also, should
this be broken down into one or multiple
prompts? And if they are multiple
prompts, could it be parallelized? is
the tasks that I'm asking for, could
they be run side by side if they're
referencing different parts of the
codebase and actually wouldn't be
editing separate things or relying on
previous steps to have been completed.
So, it's going to work out is it one
prompt, is it multiple, and if it's
multiple, should they be done
sequentially or in parallel? Then, it's
going to figure that out. Then, it's
going to look for how much reasoning it
needs. Does it need to really think
through any stages before doing that?
Does it need to examine the codebase
structure, the dependencies or existing
patterns? Should it be a concise prompt
or comprehensive on the task? What file
references, bash commands, or MCP
servers might be needed? And then
verification. Does this task warrant
built-in error checking or validation
steps? Then it's going to figure that
out and move on to the next stage, which
as I said, interaction flow here is if
it has clarification, it doesn't need
that. It then goes on to confirm that it
has figured out what it wants and it's
going to say this is a complex prompt.
Would you like me to continue? I could
then give it a little bit more context
if I need to. Most of the time I just
say yes. And what it's going to do is
it's going to then generate that prompt
and save it to a folder that if doesn't
already exist in the directory I'm in.
It creates called prompts. And then it
creates the name and the number.
Multiple prompts. It does the same
thing, but it does 001 blah blah blah
002 yada yada yada. How does it actually
create this prompt then? So, let's close
this up. The prompt construction rules.
Anthropic themselves recommend when
using Claude Code to structure your
prompts with XML tags, which are
effectively anytime you've seen
something like this where it's inside
of this little bracket, you could add in
your objective. And then having this
closing bracket means that Claude can
then parse that logic in a way that
makes much more sense to it because it's
breaking up this task into sections. So
what is the objective? What is the
context that's needed? What are the
requirements, the constraints? And
finally, what would the output be? So
it's going to figure out all of these
things and it's going to also put at the
bottom very importantly success
criteria. So if we were to have achieved
the objective using said context and
fitting into these requirements and
constraints with an output like this,
how would we define the success and also
how would we verify that we had achieved
this? So this is very important. Also
conditionally include these are all
based off of Anthropic's documentation.
But we'll just skip through these.
Sometimes if something does need
extended reasoning, it's going to add in
words like thoroughly analyze or deeply
consider. And this is going to trigger
extended thinking. Most of the time for
me that triggers the sequential thinking
MCP. Also, go beyond basics language.
When I'm saying to create like a UI for
something or a dashboard, a lot of the
time Claude will do the bare minimum and
it won't look great unless for some
funny reason. If you tell it to like
impress you, go wild, you know, go
beyond basics, it will actually stretch
and do a little bit more. Particularly
with the ability of Sonnet 4.5 to do
some really pretty long running tasks
without any interference. Also, why is
it necessary to tell us why something
must be done? Also, will it need to call
tools in parallel? We've got a bunch
more stuff here, yada yada yada. I'm
going to be uploading this prompt to
GitHub so that you can use this
yourself, but it's going to add in some
of these conditional inclusions that
might or might not be helpful. Also,
then output format. Same thing down
here. It's going to follow the same
approach every single time, adding one
to the number. So great, these are the
prompt construction rules. Then prompt
patterns. So I've got a few in here. If
it's a coding task, here's a little
example. Claude do recommend or
Anthropic's documentations do recommend
examples. So if you give something an
example of how you would like the output
to be, it's more likely to do a good job
doing it. So here we go. If it's a
coding task, it's usually going to have
the objective, the context, the
requirements, implementation, output,
verification, and success criteria.
Maybe if it's an analysis task, it's
going to look at these kind of things.
So the objectives, what files would need
to be references, what are the
requirements for set analysis? Output
and again validation to make sure that
that analysis is complete. Research,
same kind of thing. What is the scope of
the research? What do we need as
deliverables for the research?
Evaluation criteria on working out the
quality of the research. Let's close
this up. Then the intelligence rules. So
here are some important things as well.
is that clarity first. If anything is
unclear, you must ask the user before
proceeding. A few clarifying questions
save time. Would a colleague with
minimal context understand this prompt?
Context is critical. You always include
why the task matters, who it's for, and
what it will be used for in generated
prompts. Again, this is super key for
telling Claude why it's doing it, who
it's for, and what it will be.
Therefore, it's not just giving it a
task, but it's giving it context around
why this task must be completed. Also be
explicit. Again, we need to be super
clear about exactly what format is
needed for this. What files must be
created and what must they look like?
Scope assessment. Again, simple tasks
don't need massive prompts. Complex
tasks are going to need really long
prompts. Context loading only requests
file reading as an actual tool call if
the task explicitly requires
understanding existing code or
documentation. So again, it's going to
put things in there. Precision versus
brevity. Default to precision. It's okay
to write a long and clear prompt. It
beats a short and ambiguous one. Also,
tool integrations. If there are any MCP
servers that I have and it has access
to, or bash commands, file references,
it needs to mention which ones to use.
Output clarity. Again, every prompt must
specify exactly where to save its
outputs using relative paths. Every
prompt should include clear success
criteria and verification steps. This is
so so helpful. Sometimes, you know, we
ask it to do a thing, but there's no
way that in the way that it actually
implements our decision without using
meta prompting that it thinks through,
okay, after I've done this, how can I
verify that it's worked? And then also
after saving the prompt, present this
decision tree to the user. It says, if
you've created one prompt, I've saved it
here. Would you like to one, run the
prompt now, two, review and edit it,
three, save it for later, blah blah blah
blah blah. If I choose option one, it
invokes the next slash command, which is
run prompt up here, which we'll have a
look at in a sec. If it's parallel, it
will say, would you like me to run them
in parallel, and it's going to launch
three sub agents working on this with
their own context window simultaneously.
And similarly, if it's sequential, it
will do them one after the other. So,
let's just fold this up one more time.
Intelligence rules. Okay, meta
instructions. Again, first check if
clarification is needed before
generating the prompt. Also, it then
goes and reads the prompt folder to make
sure that either it exists, if it
doesn't exist, and if it does, what the
number should be. It keeps prompt file
names descriptive but concise. Adapt the
XML structure to fit the task. Not every
tag is needed every time. Consider the
user's working directory as the root for
all relative paths. Each prompt should
contain only the prompt content, no
preamble or explanation. And after
saving, present the appropriate decision
tree blah blah blah blah blah. Let's
just close this up. We got one final
thing down here of examples when to ask
for clarification. If I said build a
dashboard, you should ask the user what
kind of dashboard, admin, analytics,
user-facing, what data should it
display, fix the bug, can you describe
the bug? These are very simple things,
but you know, you want for the prompt to
push back if it doesn't feel it has the
clarity. Okay, so this is the essence of
meta prompting is the goal is not to
tell Claude what you want it to do. The
goal is to tell Claude what you would
want it to do and therefore how would it
like best to be asked to achieve that
instead of explaining what you want and
getting it to do it. You want to get it
to think about how it would best do the
task and create a prompt for that. Now,
what I love to do is not just run this
prompt directly in line in this chat
window. You know, once the prompt is
created, if I were to just say run
prompt and then I actually like tag the
prompt, it's going to use up a hell of a
lot of context in this chat window. And
also in the creation of that prompt,
it's used up a lot of context in
thinking about how to create the prompt,
which means we've actually polluted the
entire chat with context that is not
necessary while it's figuring out what
to do. The prompt in and of itself is a
self-contained solution to the problem,
which is why I have this next prompt
here called run prompt. Let's just fold
this up. The goal of this prompt is to
execute one or more prompts from the
folder as delegated subtasks. This is
that key thing. These are when they
spawn sub agents. So these are
self-contained fresh context sub agents.
The user specifies which prompt to run
via arguments or because this is in line
it will just know what to do. But the
point is here if it's a single prompt it
runs it on in and of itself. If it's
multiple prompts blah blah blah blah
blah. You can see here a little bit more
context, not super interesting to read
through, but it's basically just
explaining to Claude exactly how to
launch these prompts as subtasks. So,
let's actually have a look to see here
how we would use this in practice. So,
I'm going to run exactly the same prompt
in two different windows, except in one
of them, I'm going to create a prompt
for the prompt and then run that. and in
another I'm just gonna get Claude to do
it in one shot with no more context. So,
first I'm going to copy and paste this
prompt and I'm going to run this in the
this little folder is called with meta
prompting and then I'm going to create
one which is without meta prompting. So,
let's just go ahead and run that. And
I'm going to put this over here for
clarity. And then I'm going to create
another window. And I'm going to go back
and I'm going to go into the without
meta prompting. And I'm going to just
give it that exact direct prompt. So,
we'll say I want to create a CLI based
tool. We'll go enter. So, let's have a
little look here. You can see that it's
already asked for a bit more a little
bit more context. Whereas with here,
it's probably There we go. It's just
going I'll create a generative music CLI
tool with trippy visuals. Straight away
it started to create it. Whereas here it
wants some context. So audio library
preferences. Do you want to use a
specific node.js audio library or open
to recommendations? In this case I'm
going to say I'm open to the best
library for this given the goal. In this
case, I don't really know. Visual
rendering. Should this use terminal
graphics library like blessed? Yes, use
blessed and make it beautiful and
rainbow like and trippy. Number three,
note sequencing. You mentioned 75%
chance each 16th note plays. Should the
pentatonic notes be picked randomly?
Let's do randomly with a weighting
towards roots, octaves and first and
then fifths and then thirds etc. The
goal should be that it sounds pleasing.
Cool. Number four, runtime. Should this
run indefinitely until stopped? Yes,
indefinitely until control C. And then
five, are you okay with installing npm
packages for this or do you want minimal
dependencies? Yes, that's fine to
install. So, I'm going to run with this.
Let's go back over here. You can see
that already Claude has created in this
view a version of this. So, let's just
give it a go. I'm going to do npm start
and I'm going to open this up in another
tab and let's just see. Let's just see
what happened. Obviously, it was a lot
quicker without meta prompting, but
let's see what the quality of the
results are. Okay, so it did something,
but it's a bit crappy really. So, I'm
going to close that out. Stopping the
music. I hate how it uses these emojis,
but it did something. So, I'm curious to
see now the quality of the difference
here. Let's just make these the same
color so that we can see which one is
which. I'm going to go back to the
prompt here. So, should I proceed? Yes.
Cool. So, Claude has gone ahead and
created this prompt. Let's have a little
look to see what it is. So, the
objective. Build a terminal-based
generative music application that
creates pleasing blah blah blah blah
blah. This is for personal creative
exploration and ambient background music
generated. Nice. Here's the context.
This is a new node.js CLI application.
Audio requirements. Here are all of the
specific things that are needed. The
visual requirements. It needs to use
trippy colorful rainbow like aesthetics.
Runtime requirements. Technical
approach. So, it's going to analyze the
best approach for this implementation.
Considering the audio library selection,
timing architecture, harmonic weighting,
sample and hold logic, what to avoid?
Avoid blocking operations, uniform
random note selection. Avoid updating
sample and hold every note. Avoid
synchronous blocking, blah blah blah
blah blah. It's already decided what the
project should look like. Success
criteria and then verification. Can you
run the application? Let it play for 30
seconds. These kind of things probably
do require my effort, but let's go
ahead. So now all I have to do is just
press one. And you're going to see that
instead of now running it in this
window, it's going to launch the run
prompt prompt to then run said prompt.
You can see it's gone and found it in
this directory. I can show you that this
folder itself only has in it prompts.
Let's have a look in there. And inside
of there is that folder. What's also
nice is once the prompt has been run,
it's going to relegate that prompt to a
folder called completed. So, let's close
this up and we're going to see what's
happening. This task indicates that this
is now running in its own self-contained
sub agent workflow. Once it starts doing
stuff, we can press control O and you'll
be able to see exactly what's happening.
So, right here, it's passed through that
prompt. Let's get out of here. And we
can see that very shortly it's going to
start writing and reading and thinking
about files. So let's just let that run
and we'll come back to it in a second to
see what it's done. Okay, I've just got
back from my breakfast bagel and Claude
seems to have completed the task. We can
see here that it has created various
files, the key implementation details,
yada yada yada, and then the tools to
run it. So I'm going to go ahead and do
npm install. Let's just do this in a new
tab. npm install. And then we want to do
npm start. Very nice that we've got a
high security vulnerability there. Let's
give it a go. Kind of nice. I like that.
And I think you'll agree that the
overall adherence to my original prompt
of having a bit more of like a
structured randomness compared to this
this buggy clicky whatever's going on
here. This is a damn lot better. Nice.
Okay. So just to verify one more time
that how much more effective this is. I
want to do a little adjustment to this.
So now I want to do I want to add more
of a rainbow fractal trippy visual
aspect to it as well as some sample and
hold slightly affecting the sine waves
feedback to create little timbral
changes. And also I want to be able to
select different scales in real time by
pressing the right and left arrow keys.
So I'm just going to run this in here.
And then I'm also going to go back over
here and I'm going to say I want to add
exactly the same thing, but we're going
to do it straight one shot and then with
a prompt in between. So let's see how
this runs. and we'll compare the
results. Okay, so it actually wants a
little bit more clarification. Rainbow
fractal visuals. Do you want actual
fractal patterns like Mandelbrot? I'm
thinking something between Mandelbrot
and spirals and making it evolving and
generative and directly related to the
music. Okay. Number two, sine wave
feedback. Should this be actual audio
feedback delay or FM synthesis style? FM
synthesis style modulation. Subtle
warmth. Three. Scale selection. Should
there be a visual indicator showing
which selection? We'll say yes. It
should show in the bottom right. And we
should do all of the modes of the major
scale and also the two pentatonic scales
and then four as I said above. And I
think what's nice about this is it
really helps you refine what it is that
you want when you're asked more
questions about it. And of course,
instead of saying continue, I could have
said after this, ask me some more
questions as well. And that's so key to
being able to just be sure that what it
is that you're prompting for is going to
be what you want because sometimes you
actually have to ask yourself the
questions, do I want this? Do I want
that? How do I envision it? If you don't
know, then Claude definitely isn't going
to know. So, let's run the updated
version here in the one-shot prompt.
Okay. So, you can see that it's creating
some really kind of messed up problems
here that weren't really fixed. This
does look quite nice. I like that a lot.
Let's actually see if we were to run
this if we were to run this in just
regular terminal to see if that makes it
any better. npm start. Okay, so we're
still having all sorts of problems
there. I do love those colors. Those are
really very nice. Can I change scale?
We're in pentatonic minor now. Major
minor. Cool. So, it does work, but it's
not quite what I want. So, let's go back
to here, and we should in theory have
our updated prompt. So, let's run it,
and then let's see what we get. While
that's running, let's actually have a
look to see what the prompt was like
that it created for this enhancement. So
the objective enhancing the existing
music CLI tool with these three main
improvements context the existing
application. This is important. It tells
it about what we already have. Examine
these files. It wants to be a more
trippy fractal-based situation. Here's
the visual enhancement requirements. So
we need it to be more fractal with
generative and continuously evolving
visual style maintaining rainbow
spectrum but they should be trippy and
mesmerizing. Consider unicode box
drawing performance blah blah blah blah
blah audio enhancement requirements. So
now we need to add in a little bit more
complexity which is that feedback which
to be honest I don't think we even
really had in this view. And then let's
have a little look here. Interactive
scale selection keyboards. You just see
like how in-depth this is and all I had
to do was just answer a couple of
questions. So technical approach research
fractal generation suitable for terminal
rendering. This is baked into the prompt
before it does anything else. Scale
system FM system. Very nice. What to
avoid and why? Avoid complex fractal
algorithms in the audio thread. Avoid
harsh FM timbres. Yep, great. Avoid
pixel perfect fractal rendering. Modify
existing files, these ones. And here are
the success criteria as well as then
verification. Very nice. So, this looks
as though it's about to finish. I'd be
curious to know exactly how long it took
to do. But we'll come back to this in
one moment. Okay. It took about 8
minutes to complete that prompt, but we
are now done. Just before we dial that
in, let's give it one more occasion of
the cheap buggy crappy one, the one-shot
prompt versus what it would be if we did
those two prompts. So, here we go. I'm
very excited. Let's change key. Bit
weird what's happening up here with the
text. And now we're in pentatonic minor.
Let's do Lydian. We got a bunch of nice
scales in. Anyway, you get the idea. I
think what's just really great about
this approach is not just does it help
you understand what you want before you
ask for it, but it just makes the entire
process of actually prompting so much
easier because you don't have to think
about the things that the LLM will need
as a human being like okay well what
does Claude need instead you ask Claude
what do you need. Out of interest let's
just check out the codebase here. I've
got the without meta prompting and with
meta prompting here let's just have a
look to see how it was even constructed.
So when I just asked for it without
creating prompts beforehand it created
just this I was going to say a monolith
but it's not even really a very big
file. It's a 286 line single index.js
and then it's got some node modules
here. That's it. Let's see how it
organized things in the prompt based
one. So, you can see here that we've got
that index.js entry point. It's only 63
lines long and it references the source
files here where we've got an
independent script for audio. We've also
then got an independent script for
visuals here. Very nice. We've even got
a little readme here that explains
exactly how to use it, all that sorts of
information. So, I know that this seems
potentially a little bit long-winded,
you know, and as I said at the beginning
of this video, if you just want to
change the background color of something
to red to yellow, or you want to change
a font, there's no point you wasting the
time getting Claude to think about how
it should ask itself to do that thing.
But when you want to compound the
upgrades of what you want to make to
your system, to your codebase, I highly
recommend running this prompt beforehand
because the quality, as you can see, is
just so much better. I know that we
looked at it today in the context of
creating a CLI based tool, but this
works for refactoring, this works for
database migrations, this works for
whatever it is that you want to do that
requires a little bit more thought than
just do X thing. So highly recommend it.
I'm going to put the link to be able to
download this prompt in the description
down below. Give it a go and let me know
what you think. And also let me know if
you're interested in any more videos
about some of the prompts that I use.
I've got a couple of really exciting
ones that I think we could look at next.
But in the meantime, that's all folks
and thank you for watching.
