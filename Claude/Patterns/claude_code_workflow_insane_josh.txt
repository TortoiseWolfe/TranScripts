The guy who created Cloud Code as a side
project, yes, you heard that right, a
side project, just revealed his entire
workflow. And despite calling it
vanilla, he runs five Clouds
simultaneously, uses MCP server that
post directly to Slack, custom AI sub
agents that review his code, and
something called the Ralph Wigum plugin
that runs Claude and autonomous loops
for hours. In this video, I'm going to
break down his exact workflow so that
you can use Cloud Code like the guy who
created it. Now, I've been using Cloud
Code daily for the last couple of
months, and I thought I was good at it,
but after reading through Boris's
thread, I realized there's a lot I don't
know, and a lot of features I should be
using. Features that Boris claim can two
to 3x the quality of your AI generated
code. So, we're going to cover how to
get Claude to oneshot entire poll
requests/comands that save you from
repeating the same prompts, and that
Ralph Wiggum thing, which is way more
powerful than it sounds. Let's start
with the foundation of his workflow.
We're going to be operating on my
portfolio site because it's an easy
small enough project where I think you
can see the actual value. There are a
lot of things I like about it. It's very
pretty. But one good feature, for
example, is I have this blog post with
some code. And ideally, I'd like a copy
code button. So, let's do that. If
there's one thing you get out of this
video, it's that every session should
start with plan mode. To enter plan
mode, you're going to press shift tab
twice. You can also type slash plan and
you're going to tell it what you want to
build. Now, in this mode, Claude can
only read your codebase. It can't write
anything. [snorts] You're just going to
have a back and forth conversation until
you and Claude both agree that there's
nothing else to clarify. So, let's do
that. I want to add a copy code button
to my blogs where there is code. It's
going to look around, get all the
context that it needs, and then come
back and ask some follow-up questions.
And look at that. It'll come back and
actually remind me that there already is
one blog post that has a copy code
button which I would have forgotten cuz
I've been maintaining this blog over a
decade now. And it's asking me how I
want to do it. I have this thing called
load templates which is not a good
solution but exists and it's asking me
if I want to use that. It recommends it
and sure that's not a bad idea. Then
it's going to present me with a plan and
then I'm going to either accept it and
let it do its thing or I can accept it
and review it along the way or I could
just tell it to change something. I'm
pretty happy with this and it's a pretty
simple feature. So, we're just going to
auto accept it. It'll even tell me where
to go to see the changes. So, let's see
it. If we go down to the code, there's
this copy button. And if I paste, it's
copied it. Now, this was a simple
feature for demonstration purposes, but
it gives you an idea of what Claude can
do and how it could do it. I do think
Claude could have done it without
entering plan mode, but it's good
practice. And Porus himself says, and I
quote, "A good plan is really important.
Once you like to plan, only then do you
switch to auto accept mode, and Cloud
can usually oneshot the entire
implementation." When I first started
adding AI to my workflow, I would ADHD
just tell it to do something. And most
of the time was spent being like, "Oh,
not like that." But now I spend more
time planning and less time debugging,
which honestly is the entire job. And it
helps me think through what I'm trying
to do more clearly cuz that is the job
of software engineering. And so even if
you have really simple features, I
encourage you to get into this habit of
entering plan mode regardless because
even for this simple feature, it found
me a better solution. And turns out I
would have repeated some code that I had
forgotten about. The second foundational
piece is something called cloud.md. And
I'm just going to show you what that
looks like. This is my cloud MD file. It
lives in your repo and kind of acts like
Claude's memory. It's where you document
your project's rules, patterns, and
preferences for you and your team. So
here it'll tell it the architecture, the
key files, the development, how to
actually run it, the design system, how
to add a blog post, etc. Now to actually
make one it's quite simple. You type
flash in itit and it'll comb through
your codebase and generate this
document. Now there is one thing that
Boris does that is completely new to me.
He actually tags Claude in his teammates
pull request and ask it to add learnings
to claude.md as part of the PR. So every
time someone on his team merges code,
the repos memory gets smarter and it's a
guarantee that whatever nit happened on
that pull request won't need to happen
again. I'm not going to do it here
because my portfolio site is only run by
me. Uh you would do install GitHub app
and that would allow you to call Claude
from Now we get to the stuff that Boris
calls his inner loop. It's the stuff
that he does multiple times a day. Boris
uses custom slash commands for every
repeated task. His most used one. You
won't be surprised to learn that it's
commit push PR. Now, you'll see that I
don't have it because it's a custom
slash command just for him. And your
custom slash commands will probably be
personalized to your workflow and what
works for you. Now, I do have to commit
and push a lot. So, we're actually going
to copy Boris here and make it together.
The benefit of this is that instead of
having to type out instructions each
time, you can just type out the command
and cloud code knows exactly what to do.
So to make our own, we're going to make
a folder at our root
calledcloud/comands.
And then inside of that, we're going to
make a custom markdown file. Let's call
ours commit. Now, here's a trick that
Boris uses to make his commands actually
run quickly. You can embed commands into
your command with back. So instead of
claude asking what's the get status, it
already knows and you don't even need to
waste tokens on it coming up with that.
So for example here I'll tell it here's
the current git status and then this
command is going to run and then it's
going to fill with the output of that
terminal command. You'll give it your
recent commits and then you'll say
something like create a commit based on
these stage changes. Now let's run it
and see what it looks like based off the
changes that it [clears throat] made.
Here we go. It'll take a sec. I should
have said that it should also add and
commit, but sure, we'll have it commit
all files. Now, you can probably guess
that if I wanted to, I could have added
everything and at the end of it push,
but that's just an example of how you
can save all those words into one nice
little function. If you've used cloud
code before, you'll know that there is a
big optimization with permissions. If I
ask Claude to do pretty much anything,
it's going to ask you, do I have
permission to do this? and you have to
approve it every single time. Let's come
up with an example. I asked it to look
up a website and see if it's good and
it's going to ask me permission. Now,
you shouldn't blindly accept permissions
for everything, but there are some
pretty obvious ones that aren't too bad.
In order to set this up, run /missions
and you can add a new rule. Now, you may
have to look up how to get the specific
syntax of the command that you want, but
for example, if I say, hey, web fetch is
all good. It'll ask you, do you want
this locally as a project or your user
settings? I'm just going to say locally
cuz I don't want that to actually impact
everything. Now, adding these and
clarifying them have helped keep me in a
flow state. No interruptions for things
I know are safe because I don't need
that to take up mental space in my
workflow. And notice it's really
important he's not using a command. I I
don't even want to teach you this
command. Honestly, you shouldn't even
know. Just don't do it.
There is a way to skip everything called
dangerously skip permissions.
As you can assume, it won't ask you a
single question and it'll just start
doing stuff. I do not recommend running
like this. Instead, I recommend
evaluating which permissions you're
actually okay with and adding it via
that interface that I just showed you.
Now, these are pretty simple, but we're
going to start getting into some of the
power features. Boris uses custom AI sub
agents that run after Claude finishes a
task. You can think of these as
specialized assistants. He has one
called the code simplifier that cleans
up code after it's written.
[clears throat] another called verify
app that has detailed instructions for
testing the entire application and all
these other ones that are specific to
his workflow. Let's create one together.
Just like before, we're going to make a
directory called claude/ aents. And in
that directory, let's say we're going to
create one called code simplifier this
markdown. So we'll say name code
simplifies code after changes tools it
has access to. And then below this will
actually give a description of what it
is. You are a code simplication expert.
Now people usually laugh at other people
that say things like this. You are an
expert. You are a senior dev. But
there's actually a really good reason
why it works. If you're interested in
that, I could make a whole video about
that. It's very interesting. After code
is written, remove unnecessary
complexity. And now that we've made this
file, I can say things like use code
simplifier to clean up load templates.js
and a specialized agent that we've
written will take over. Now, obviously,
this isn't a very sophisticated one, but
you can have one for your UI, your UX,
or your copy, etc. You can have one for
really whatever you can imagine. You'll
see here that it calls in code
simplifier and now it is acting within
the description that we gave it. And
apparently it has a lot of opinions. I'm
a little offended honestly, but
whatever. And now have done some pretty
good things. It extracts logic into a
function, uses a sign, moves CSS to a
constant. All of these seem like
generally good things. Now, next we have
a small thing that prevents a lot of CI
failures. Boris actually runs a hook
that automatically formats code after
Claude edits it. Claude's code is
usually formatted correctly, but here's
an example of how you can use a hook to
handle that last 10% so that you never
fail CI on format. Now, there are quite
a few hooks you can use. There's one for
before you use claw. There's one for
after. There are ones for notifications,
etc. But the one that we're concerned
with is post tool use. Now, in order to
add this, we're going to just call
/hooks and we're going to do post tool
use, which is again after claud writes.
It's going to ask you after cla does
what? It gives you all these options,
but we're just going to say after you
write or after you edit, we're going to
call a command. Let's say mpm run lint.
And we'll just save that locally. And
now, every time that claude writes code
in your codebase, it's going to lint
your code. Now, this one's actually
insane and one I'm really pushing to use
at work more. You can get Claude to not
just code, but also do things like post
to Slack, run big query analytics, and
even grab error logs from Sentry or
Rollar. Now, you'll see here there are
so many servers you can add. I guarantee
you that whatever systems you're working
with, they're probably in here. We're
just going to choose this one cuz it
seems interesting. I don't know what
kiwi.com is if I'm being honest, but it
says we can search for flights and I do
like to travel. So, we're just going to
copy this. We're going to go back here.
And now we've added it. Let's go into
Claude. If we type /mcp, we can see that
we are actually connected. And now that
we've confirmed it's there, let's search
for some flights. Uh, find me the
cheapest flight from Austin to New
Zealand. I've been wanting to go to New
Zealand. Let's see what we could do.
This might take a sec. I'm not sure how
good this is. Now, it'll come back with
all these options, which are admittedly
pretty bad, but it's giving me options
saying this is the cheapest. this one
two three with three stops which is kind
of insane or this one which only has one
stop connect to something like Slack.
You can have it read from Slack or you
can have it right to Slack as well. Now
this is a silly example but you can use
it with Atlassian and you can use it
with Slack. You can use it with Jira to
write your tickets for you. You can do
it to open PRs for you. And this ends up
turning Claude code from just a coding
assistant to an interface for your
entire development ecosystem. Now, next
part of this is something that Boris
claims is very important for him. It
allows Claude to run for extremely long
amount of time. I haven't personally
done this because I'm still building
that trust with the system to just fully
let it run for hours and it costs a lot
of money. The way that he's using stop
hooks is when Claude says it finish a
task, sometimes it's not actually done
and you need to follow up. And so what
Boris will do is he will spawn a
verification agent that will check its
work and say no you're not done keep
working or it will confirm that it's
done and be like oh you're good. So in
order to do that similar to the other
hook we set up we go to hooks we go all
the way down to stop and then same way
we would have to define what that
verification looks like and then add it
in here. This creates a feedback loop
without you having to babysit and allows
people to run cloud code for hours until
it finishes an entire codebase, which is
not necessarily how I imagine using it,
but that is an option that you should
know about if you are going to use cloud
code. And now, finally, we get to the
thing with the really weird name. The
Ralph Wiggum plugin is named after the
Simpsons character. It was invented by a
developer named Jeffrey Huntley, and
it's kind of correct. Instead of Claude
working on a task once and stopping,
Ralph keeps Claude working in loops
until it genuinely succeeds. Very
similar to the stop hook before it. The
results, and remember this is reported
from Twitter, these results, if they're
true, are actually insane. Jeffrey
Huntley apparently ran a 3month
autonomous loop that built an entire
programming language. and another
engineer completed a $50,000 contract
for $297 in API costs. If someone could
let me know where these $50,000
contracts are, I'd be very grateful. But
it turns out that it's not intended to
be used for everything. You wouldn't use
it for simple tasks. But for large
refactors, batch operations, or grinding
through hundreds of support tickets,
this is where it shines. This is my
first time installing it as well. So,
let's uh see what all the hubs about.
install Ralph Wiggum install for you.
Just as a test, we'll actually run this
on something I've been meaning to do for
a long time. Although, I'm not going to
lie, I'm a little scared. We're going to
run this on my website and we're going
to do a stress test. I'm a little scared
to do this. I don't know how it's going
to go, but everyone's raving about it.
The creator of Claude Code says it's
good and so we should try it out. So, if
you click on my blog, older blogs have
not migrated over to our new style. So,
if you click on our new style, you'll
see that it is a much better user
experience. And on top of that, I still
haven't quite standardized the styling
across everything. There are some minor
differences, but overall styles
developing. You'll see I have this bar
on the left, which isn't there in the
base. Anyway, we're going to go back and
we're going to push this thing to its
limits. create a unified styling based
on my most recent articles blog posts
and migrate old blog posts to use this
new style. Do max iterations 50. It is
chugging away and I'm actually a little
nervous that the cost of this. It's all
good. We're stress testing it. Um it's
got some ways to go and yeah, I'll ch
when it's done. It not look like it's
stopping. Oh my god, there are still 20
more. All right, I mean this is
interesting. It said this is taking too
long. Let me launch some parallel tasks
to help migrate the remaining posts. So
I think now there are three agents that
are working on this. Well, it seems to
have finished and I'm honestly it's not
perfect. I It's really good. Don't get
me wrong. Honestly, it's better than
what I had here before. But there are
some things apparently we lost the copy
code that we had. So that's unfortunate.
These diagrams, they were ugly to begin
with, but now that they're not centered,
they're especially ugly. Uh, but I will
say this one, I wrote this probably in
2020. Oh, wow. Look at that. Holy crap
is right. See, this is a weird thing
that's going on. Oh, I really like the
way it's incorporated colors, but it's
not perfect.
It's definitely not perfect. Bujo. All
right. Our successful open source
project. Honestly, I don't think I'm
going to keep it. I think asking cloud
code to do something as large as this
while people are talking about it on X
are really just a money sync. I think
that costs me $10.
I think it will get there and I think
there will be a day where it can do that
and that day is probably sooner than I
think. But as of right now, having as
part of your workflow is really the best
way to use this. Now, I just want to
look at this together because Boris says
that this is the most important thing to
get great results out of Claude code.
It's to give Claude a way to verify its
work. If Claude has that feedback loop,
it will two to 3x the quality of the
final result. Claude tests every single
change I land using the Claude Chrome
extension. It opens a browser, tests the
UI, and iterates until the code works
and the UX feels good. Verification
looks different depending on what you're
working on. It might look as simple as
running a bash command, running a test
suite, or testing the app in a browser
or phone simulator. Maybe if I had done
this or my portfolio sites, I'd have to
be a little creative as to what that
looks like. I think I probably could
have gotten away with it. So, that's how
the creator of Cloud Code actually uses
Cloud Code. To recap, one, start in plan
mode. Two, build your CloudMD over time.
Three, use SL commands for repeated
workflows. Four, pre-allow safe
permissions. Five, deploy sub aents for
review and testing. Six, auto format
with post tool use hooks. Seven, connect
external tools with MCP. Eight, use stop
hooks for verification. And nine, I
don't recommend this, but just know that
Ralph Wigum is available. I'll always
continue testing things cuz that's just
what I do. I can't help it. And if
anything mind-blowing happens, I will
report it here. My videos are usually
using tech for entertainment, but I
think I have some value to share and
hope that you found it useful. If you
did find this useful, please like and
subscribe and spend some time with your
loved ones. Am I?
